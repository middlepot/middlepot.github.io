hiiii fluffies <sub>🎄</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
merry xmas !!! please be kinder to yourself this next year ..
it has been a busy but very good month so far !
i got a lot of work, specially since i officially opened commissions for blogger and tumblr layouts.. it's really good since december is a month spending can go a little bit wild sometimes ( i'm trying my best to save money though <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font> )

talking on tumblr,, i made the hard decision of getting rid of my graphics blog since it wasn't really being useful .. i wasn't paying much attention to it recently, and i don't intend to continue. this blog didn't have much original content anyway, so i want to focus on my aesthetic blog and my other accounts that matter most to me !
i made a small change in my social media by choosing a new user that could be original and available for using in all of them : <b>@pooftie</b>
now my 4 accounts have the same user, which makes it way easier to find me and keep everything organized <sub>🎀</sub>
as you may already know, pooftie is how i call all the critters that i've created for my "poofties" project ! it's a very special word for me <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>

changing subjects, i decided to make my own virtue chart based on personal goals and some research i did recently .. it was hard finding the proper words but i believe it turned out okay
virtue charts can be really useful for valuating your self improvement process making sure you're going through the right path, because going too far will end up hurting yourself and/or other people !</pre><br>

</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i hope it can help you understand more about your feelings, natural tendencies, what you aim for & traits that could be improved in a healthy way <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
while i was writing it i realized that some things i was forcing myself into were actually being harmful to my mental health for i was taking it too far.. if you tend to be harsh on yourself and feel overwhelmed, please be careful <sub>☂️</sub>

i'm so excited for this next year, very good life changes will happen and i'll keep trying my best...
please do your best too, and don't forget the xmas spirit !! let's make good memories and forget about the problems
i will have a very special xmas with only bubu for the first time .. we'll cook together and have purely comfy time <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font></pre><br>
xoxo <sub>💟</sub></pre>

hiii fluffies <sub>💓</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
this month .. i worked a whole lot but i somehow managed to rest a lot more than i usually do
i had some very energetic moments, extremely sleepy moments, talkative moments and completely quiet moments !!
it was a mess and i'm tired, but at least i did things i'm very proud of that i want to show you today <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i hope my emotions will get together this new month so i can feel less anxious. when i'm all over the place like this i always get confused at some point, act out of myself, feel dissociated and get embarrassed <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
but everything is okay, after all, it's natural to have different moods and i'm always doing my best and learning from any mistakes ( even the smallest ones )
i will make sure to be patient..
i have to put myself first if i want to be happy, being a caring person includes caring about my own well-being and validating my efforts !!
i know that forcing myself to socialize is big part of my anxiety so i will keep cautious not to overdo it and stay in a safe place.
i can and will make people smile within my capacity, fill my life with good experiences while respecting my limits. <sub>🧁</sub>
also, a little reminder for me and anyone reading this : be yourself. self improvement is not about trying to fit in. it doesn't matter if someone would like you more if you acted like this or that, it doesn't matter if someone thinks you're weird, it doesn't matter. stay pure and be proud of who you are. don't try to get included, don't base your growth on what others see, it's not worth it.
focusing on my improvement, creating content i feel truly proud of and decentralizing the attention of my ego is what i long for !! enough of pain for not being perfect for others, i will perfect myself.. for myself <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i love helping, i want to inspire and be inspired. i must keep myself pure if i want to heal. only a heart full of love can spread kindness !

let's go for the content !! this month i made some really cute things, i'm excited to show you <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
first, my secret project from poofties, finally started :</pre><br>

these will be a series of 1min videos with this *big* story i have in mind for.. some years now
everything made with collages of real life things, except for the characters !!
i think it looks really cute, it takes a long while to search, edit and put everything together but i had a lot of fun <sub>🌷</sub>
the "voice acting" is absolutely amateur ( and a little embarrassing ) but i'm okay with this.. what can i do ? LOL
please let me know your opinions, i'm not used to video editing and some things ( specially the audio ) can be a little off so i would really appreciate the opinion of someone more experienced

all the melodies used will be composed by me ( i've already started with the next one actually )
this is the one i've used in this episode :</pre><br>

a lively and adorable midi, i'm happy with it <sub>🐇</sub>
not the most creative melody because i wanted these to be simple and not distracting, so expect to hear some loops !

the next thing i'm showing today is a simple but lovely idea a friend gave me : collage wallpapers with self care reminders !</pre><br>

as you already know, i love making collages, it's really relaxing for me so i will certainly make some more of these in the near future.. !
it's always nice to practice making visuals with different aesthetics, right ?

i hope you, lovely reader, is taking good care of yourself <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
the year is almost finished .. let's fill our hearts with hope for new experiences

hiiii fluffies <sub>🎃</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
happy halloween !!
are you excited ? i'm going to eat lots of candy with bubuuuu <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
it's time to listen to halloween music : "dancing christmas in the 13th month" from ragnarok online & "haunted disco" from club penguin are my classic choices LOL
for some reason the climate decided to get cold, maybe to put me into the autumn mood and feel happier !? i even got flu but i'm happy, i hope it stays like this until halloween <sub>🧇</sub>

i'm very motivated lately and doing lots of things !!
i have some projects going on lately but first i will keep the tradition of posting a flash game.
every october i've been making a flash game, but for next year i'm thinking of something new ... i actually wanted to make my games work on mobile, and of course i would need to remake them into html5, and i am really not into javascript so it would be a nightmare for me ; ;
i'll test some things and see how it turns out, bubu really likes coding so he can help me with the process.. i hope i can remake them all little by little, let's see !
for now, if you haven't seen it yet, here is the recent game i made :</pre><br>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
click to play it ( if you're on pc ) !!
it took me a while to draw everything but it turned out so cute, i'm very proud <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
and this is the melody i made for it :</pre><br>

i think it sounds very gentle.. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
now !! i have a q&a text for today, that is a tutorial for phone customization people have been requesting since last post <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
it will not be a long tutorial with pictures and everything since it's actually quite an easy app to use !</pre><br>

<br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center><br>
<pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">first of all, you need to install this app called <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.a_tm.android.launcher" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">+home</font></a> , for android !
this is a themes app where you can download icons, backgrounds and stuff .. however you don't have to download any of that ! i've already downloaded themes to use icons and some widgets but currently i just use the default app theme ( which will replace your main screen ).
what i do is change the background and icons for png images with transparent background i have in the gallery, and this is the biggest secret : this app is the best i know for customization because it allows you to customize everything with your own images, it's very intuitive, you just have to click and hold on the app icons and choose what you want.
you can also change the size of the icons, the size of the letters, if you want applications to have names ( you can also rename them ) and you can make app folders and organize everything, you can also change the folder icons.
the app drawer page ( where all of them appear ) don't have customizable icons, but you don't have to use it if you don't want to, you can just organize everything into folders on the homepage ; but important : you need to go into this app drawer area, click the settings symbol and refresh the page whenever you install any new apps or you won't be able to place the icon on your homepage ! therefore, i recommend leaving the icon of this page somewhere for easy access.
so, basically touch and hold the main screen and try all the customization options you find until you're satisfied ! you can also place images floating on the screen with the photo widget ( they can have transparent background too )
tip : you will only see ads while customizing some things in the settings and sometimes on the app drawer page so it's not a bother, but ads will also appear if you leave an app folder with empty space. just fill all the folders so that doesn't happen !
</pre>
<br><br>
that's it for today, i hope you all have fun this halloween <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font><br>
be careful not to have a stomachache from eating too much candy !!<br>

hiii fluffies <sub>🐈</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it's that time of the year again .. spring time for me, autumn time for many others...
this post will be more springy but the next one will be halloween themed <sub>🌷</sub>

these days has been very interesting. i'm still in the balanced mood, which is very good, but i still had some bad days ; ;
i have a hard time dealing with dissociation from time to time .. for some reason
i usually feel it when i see people thinking bad things of me that are not true, but it doesn't make much sense if you think about it <sub>🌧</sub>
i mean,, let whoever think whatever, right !?
easier said than done.. but of course i will not give up, i will keep trying my best to just "hmpf" over people's impressions on me !!
it's not worth it feeling all anxious and worried about who i am just because sometimes stereotypes are stronger than my attitudes <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
i know who i am, i know i'm the best me i ever was - and becoming better - so just let people be, they don't know me <sub>🌱</sub>

well i have many projects going on now, many things to show,, but !! i'm still finishing most of these so i'm gonna show you the recently finished stuff :
i have this lovely drawing i painted & edited, that turned out as a very lovely wallpaper <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font></pre><br>

<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i really really like it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
it's so so comfy too, i wish i had this quilt irl <sub>🛏</sub>

i have been experimenting with collages and image editing a lot recently, so i ended up deciding to reorganize & customize my phone !
this is how it turned out ( i'm very proud ) :</pre><br>
<br><br>

<center><img width="auto" height="400px" src="https://i.imgur.com/FB1yE5M.png"/> <img width="auto" height="400px" src="https://i.imgur.com/B5wEFcC.png"/></center><br>

</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
the app icons look like part of the background collage, it's so cute <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i made a secret folder there to put the apps i don't use a lot, not to take up unnecessary space on the main screen
i can find everything easily now, i choosed all images carefully so there is actually a meaning behind all of these !
and the moomin lock screen is very cute too, don't you think ?

that's about it for today.. i'm preparing some very cute stuff for the next posts so keep an eye open !!
stay safe and keep doing your best always <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🌼</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
finally, i got in a balanced mood while i can be productive but also rest <sub>🐝</sub>
this is such a relief because i've got to start and finish some personal projects, made new things for the shy bunny store + got enough sleep, chatted with friends, didn't felt super anxious.. !!
i hope i can keep it like this for a long time because i'm feeling so much joy <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

i've also become more active on my accounts, making content and being interactive !
( careful not to get overwhelmed !! - i gotta keep reminding myself, always )
i finally started using the "close friends" function of instagram in a more organized way now : while i post self care reminders for everyone i always have some more personal stuff to share with my mutuals ( like venting or showing my self improvement )
i believe this is quite related to the acc purpose for it can motivate others to overcome their own troubles, but i'm just too shy to post it for all of my followers so i keep the public content more impersonal <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>

it's a little hard to be productive while respecting my schedule, but i got it pretty well these last weeks <sub>🐌</sub>
i know it's a good phase and phases come and go,, but i do feel proud of myself for having good phases just as often as the bad ones .. actually, these bad phases are not even bad, i just have a hard time accepting that i deserve ( and need ) to chill and be lazy sometimes ; ;
one day, i know, i will love myself the way i deserve <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>

now changing subjects , after receiving many requests of mutuals, i decided to share my line acc in my links page !!
i made a new one, with a very cute id ( pooftie ) and i'm happy <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
while discord is my fav app for group chat ( because of all the features & bots ) line is actually my fav for private messages,, it's the app i use for talking with bubu and we even have matching pfp there <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
as you already know i love collecting line themes, stickers & emojis..
i use this app for some years now and i really like it, so i would like to add more friends there <sub>💟</sub>
i think discord private messages are really boring - just like line groups are boring - so for me both complement each other perfectly !!
of course i use any chat in any account i have for talking with people, if they prefer like this, but i do have my own preferences ..

soo, lately i've been doing a cleaning in my wardrobe, then i realized i only use 1/3 of my clothes..
most of it was basic clothes from when i was a teenager and wasn't sure of my style yet, i was keeping these there just because LOL
i gave most of it to friends and my younger cousins, but some of these were actually cute and has potential !!
now that i can sew, i tried renewing these and make them perfect for me again : i fixed them, added lace, ribbons & details <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
now i have a lot of cute "new" clothes that i'm very excited to try out !!!
i also have been sewing some, and bought some others from thrift stores,, so i'm completely satisfied.
i never had so many cute clothing before !!
i'm gonna show you one of my favorite outfits :</pre><br>

isn't it absolutely precious ? 
the little apron is just.. too cute ; ;
( i also made a "full body" apron with the same fabric and lace but it's actually for using in a practical way, not as accessory )

now, i have a collage that i made recently and wanted to show you :</pre><br>

thank you ,, for everyting <sub>❤️</sub>

after a very energetic phase, my slow mood is back <sub>🐌</sub>
i still keep doing my tasks, but i haven't really did much extra this month ~
since august is a special month for me, i think it's a well deserved time for me to just relax, right ?
but i hope i will feel motivated soon so i can keep going with my projects because i have lots of things i want to try out !!
i have been sewing some things, but my big projects are staying still until i feel 100%
maybe all i need is just going outside a little more <sub>🚲</sub>
making good memories with bubu is always the best way to make me super motivated <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font>

so, as i said in the previous post i was trying some new embroidering techniques..
i made two very cute frames with a teddy bear and a bunny :</pre><br>

i really like it, i think it turned out so delicate .. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
what do you think of these ? have you ever seen this kind of embroidering ?
i wanted them to have lots of lace, ribbons and cute details
these are on <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">my online store</font></a>, so go check it out !!

hiiii fluffies <sub>❤️</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i'm proud of myself <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!
i've been making a lot of progress in my projects and improving ..
i hope i can keep this productive mood so i can be rewarded in my bday, that is coming soon ~ 
please don't forget to check out <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">my online store</font></a>, i need support to buy more crafting supplies <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
i'm gonna add new stuff very soon !
next post i'll show you the best things i made <sub>🫖</sub>

my accounts have been growing a lot lately and it makes me really happy.. i have no words to explain ; ;
i love making content that make people smile, i try my best to keep my accounts helpful & safe for everyone ...
i don't believe in taking numbers as a sign that i'm being sucessful, but i've been checking my followers frequently and removing all the creeps and ghosts, i want all of my followers to be real people that are truly interested in my content !
besides being only mutuals with friends, i can safely say that i really appreciate every single person that interact with my posts <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
all of my comfy & positive content is made with my honest feelings, so yes, i am happy that my accounts are growing !!
i can reach all of these lovely people with my stuff, it's surely a good thing, it's exactly the reason why i keep my accounts and don't just post everything in this website.
sadly, personal websites are not that popular nowadays, so if i want to really help people in some way i need to keep some social media accounts ..
tumblr is my fav place to post images in original quality ; youtube is my fav place to make playlists ; twitter is my fav place to post ascii art ; instagram is my fav place to post interactive content .
i really want to post all of these things, to inspire and make people smile with these things.. !
if i can't reach many people by simply posting everything in my website, i am keeping these accounts happily,
until the day i feel that they're not useful anymore <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

btw, recently i've been getting tired of my tumblr layout, so i decided to finally make a new one !
i'm so happy, it warms my heart ..</pre><br>

if you want to have a cute website remember that commissions are open <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

that's it for today, now i'm gonna embroider a little bit.. wish me luck !

the shy bunny store is finally open worldwide <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!
( please check it out on shybunny.store )
i've worked so hard for it to happen.. and it's been worth it already, i'm proud of myself !
i'm in very berry productive phase now, as expected.. i knew it <sub>🍮</sub>
i sewed a lot of stuff, made lots of cute new items for the store and i want to make even more this next month.
also, i made my first clothing <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
it's a lovely dress.. i also made a cute bow headdress i'll use with it !!
so yes, if i use these + the frilly socks i made : it's a full outfit made 100% by myself
you have no idea how much it means to me.. i'm really happy !
look at these :</pre><br>

<br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it's simple, but so pretty.. <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
i'm going to make more outfits soon, and as soon as i make a little more money and buy more fabric i'll surely put some clothing on the store !!
( i also want to make some cute purses )

about my instagram acc.. in addiction to my "self care calendar" idea i showed you before, i made some other templates for daily track & planning !
i want to start using these frequently now in my phone, every morning, since it's the time of the day i check my apps.
i was trying to keep these things "physically" ,
but it sadly turned out a little messy <sub>🌧</sub>
i think i'm not very good with planners, even though i love stationery stuff .. i always want to make everything to look perfect so it becomes easily stressful and time consuming <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
these virtual templates will be very useful for me, so now it's not just something i do for helping others but also myself.. !
i will not post my personal lists in public since my acc is focused on self care posts only, but as always , i'll share some of these with close friends <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

sooo.. about the q&a, i actually don't have any interesting subject to write about this time ;  ;
usually the requests i receive are self care related, but i will try to explain how i keep my writing organized :

　<sub>📍</sub>　i write texts about specific topics on /blog
　<sub>📍</sub>　i write tips about daily problems on /help
　<sub>📍</sub>　i write self care reminders on my ig acc

i've been receiving requests that would fit into the help page and ig acc , but not on the blog...
i will surely write more q&a texts once i get an interesting topic request !
and, it doesn't have to be self care related, i write about life in general, if it's something i want to express my opinion about.. !

i hope i haven't disappointed you .. i've been posting a lot in other places so please check them out ,

hiiii fluffies <sub>💝</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i think i've started existing in a new reality..
the reality where the smaller things give me energy for avoiding all bad things with a smile !!!
if even a cry baby like me can feel that confident,
i'm sure you reading it can, too <sub>🐑</sub>

i'm currently in a lazy social phase where i want to talk with people, make friends, share memories together.. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!
and, well.. i'm being really slow with my projects, but i'm trying my best to keep doing my weekly tasks anyways <sub>🎗</sub>
but of course socializing can be very stressful for me and that's why these phases just happen on internet so i can keep myself safe and cautious !
i'll share with you some things i've learned the past weeks :

ⅰ.　everyone deserves a chance !! even the weirdest people can turn out to be really nice, so even if someone seem weird give them a chance and be friendly !
ⅱ.　in the other hand, some people who seem to be super nice can be meanies in the end of the day.. so always keep an eye open and don't go trusting people too quickly...
ⅲ.　manipulative people don't deserve your friendship, stay far away from people who make you feel bad for receiving attention !!!
ⅳ.　don't keep hate in your heart, let it go and be happy ! but never forget that bad people are bad and shouldn't be trusted. it's not your responsability to make them improve and accept them in your life, keep away and just hope for their best.

mm as i said, i haven't been very good in making things lately... but i did something cute !
i colored and made some edits in this adorable drawing from paper doll mate :</pre><br>

i've been decorating my doll house, and it's becoming really cute.. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i will take pics once it's finished, but it will surely take a long while, many details ; ;

so.. that's it for today. i will be back soon !</pre>

hiii fluffies <sub>💕</sub><br>
have you been doing your best ?<br>
i've been.. doing a lot ...<br>
i finally opened commissions for website layouts, as you can see on the index page !<br>
i really love web design, but i never felt really like people would really want to pay for my work..<br>
well, after receiving so many questions about my website and how i make it, i decided to open myself to it and did my first commission <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
i'm really proud of myself, now i can work hard to make people happy in other ways besides my current projects.<br>
<br>
i also opened a <a id="linkzinho" href="https://ko-fi.com/middlepot" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5">ko-fi</font></a> account, since i really am in need of some money right now for buying a new laptop.. it's been hard working with it, but i'm doing my best ; ;<br>
i have some active projects rn and some more to come that i'm working with, so if you like any of my works please consider supporting me.. ! it would mean the world to me, and help a whole lot.<br>
remember you can now also support me by buying a <a id="linkzinho" href="https://middlepot.com/commissions" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5">layout commission</font></a> or buying something from my <a id="linkzinho" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5">online store</font></a> !<br>
( you can also buy small items on the shy bunny store if you live overseas, just please consider the long delivery time )<br>
<br>
i appreciate a lot all the supporting messages i receive from you all and i want to keep going with my current works, even if most of them don't give me any profit, i still keep going with all my love and dedication <sub>🎗</sub><br>
i know some of my projects have been stagnant, but i'm not giving up on them, don't worry !<br>
i'm just focusing on my main ones right now, but i will surely take some time for everything i planned.<br>
if you want to see something specifically here or in my accs, please contact me and i will certainly consider it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
eee now, i have today a very cute html page i've been wanting to do for.. a week LOL<br>
it's "my simulation of the perfect imageboard for me"<br>
i out of nowhere wanted to do it because i was remembering all the time i spent on imageboards when i was younger and i always wanted to make a cute and positive one ~<br>
( i don't think people would even enter it actually, it's too girly )<br>
by the way, the q&a today will be about imageboards ! i wanted to talk about it because most people don't really understand the point of these sites and think they're just bad, but it's not really like that.<br>
it's complicated, and i stopped using them for a long time now, but i certainly miss exchanging content and stories with all the interesting people i could find on the weirdest boards !<br>
i specially liked threads about "trying to find" specific content or observing bizarre communities... these became renegade thread themes on ibs over time, and i don't know why, since these were so much fun ??<br>
people seem to only like talking about boring stuff now.. ughie <sub>🧼</sub><br>
well, enough of talking, here :<br>

it's obviously a fake imageboard, you can't post anything, it's just visuals !<br>
the layout is inspired by futaba, which i believe it's the first "chan". i love the 90s look of it, despite it being born in 2001 <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i'm sorry about my weird japanese, i just wanted to make some inside jokes there LOL<br>
i was not very creative about the domain this time, but here we go : ch.pooftie.me<br>
<br>
do you like it ? would you use it ?<br>
only cuteness allowed <sub>💓</sub><br>
<br>
now let's go to the q&a and continue the subject..<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">i have seen many people saying that imageboards are toxic and hateful environments. i have had particularly varied experiences in such environments, not just ibs but other places that are also open to different subjects, and because these are anonymous environments, it is easy to see people saying hateful thoughts..
such people may or may not have gone through difficult things in life and they feel the need to vent terrible things on the internet. i consider myself a very patient person with open environments like this, because i've already been able to talk about very interesting and fun subjects with good-hearted people in places like this. it is possible to have good experiences !
currently, i have found it very difficult to find good content on the more popular imageboards, as these places have become quite the focus of hate texts, once they gain popularity among extremist movements. i definitely do not support or pay attention to this sort of thing, since it doesn't do any good for anyone.
but i will be honest with you : i feel safer seeing random hate speech on anonymous forums than on social media. that's because on an anonymous place you know that people are being honest and silly without thinking much, while when people are straightforward being hateful on an open, public website, using their real life names and all that ... isn't that super scary ??
i mean, it just shows that some groups of people aren't, at all, afraid or ashamed to say such things for everyone to see, but even worse, trying to get reputation on that. trying to get LIKES over hate speech. it makes me sick !
( yes, sometimes it's just edgy behavior, but sometimes it isn't, and it's hard to tell.. )

i used to go to these places with some frequency because it was easy to find ibs where the anonymity was absolute, that is, it was not spoken in gender or any subject that revealed particularities about the users. this avoided most of the unpleasant and problematic issues, leaving room for healthy and interesting discussions. i learned a lot and met very nice people in these spaces.
i still really like to visit ibs, but unfortunately, it's a bit hard to find ibs that are full 100% anonymous nowadays. more often you will find places where you must be of a specific gender, and i find that a bit silly sometimes ( though i do appreciate safe female spaces ) .
many people say there are rejections in specific places against groups of people as well. this is real, but not just in anonymous places, i've seen it all over the internet ( and out of it too ) !!
if you pay close attention, you will find all sorts of people rejecting and avoiding contact with other types of people, because they had bad experiences multiple times. that's basically it.
i believe that any passive or aggressive rejection against people by their sєx, age, beliefs, tastes, thoughts, is the fruit of past bad experiences. i don't like to judge people by such attitudes as long as they can be understanding, i think no one need to accept interactions with people who don't want to, i think it's important to respect environments made for a specific type of audience. i've never disrespected public rules anywhere because it seems to me too immature to force your presence into places where you're not welcome just to be "edgy" or "revolutionary" ; it's disrespectful to use personal information as an advantage in anonymous places, i don't support this. but obviously i can't stand threatenings or hate texts, as this is sick and negative !
i really value respect among people and believe that anonymity should serve to make people "impartial" and away from judgments, to say what they really think, so that it can be productive for the personal development of everyone. it is possible to exchange good arguments and spend good moments of entertainment and learning with people if they respect each other and don't judge for personal details. i believe that anonymity makes environments nicer for complicated topics, an environment becomes pure from the moment people don't have personal information about each other.
please don't be hateful, please don't be mean !! it's hard to deal with differences, but people are not supposed to hate each other. everyone is different and have problems, and that's okay. you don't have to interact with people you don't like, but it's not right to write hate texts ; ;

i support anonymous discussion environments, and respect above all. my good experiences were much more relevant than the bad ones, although i have a hard time finding comfortable places on internet as a whole, i know it's possible !
unfortunately ibs can be, indeed, very dirty places, frequented by frustrated teenagers who want to feel special and part of some sort of "secret movement" that rules the world through memes.. seriously. although i believe myself in "the power of the internet", using it to feel better than others is pathetic.

fortunately, i still know places on the internet that are good for healthy anonymous interaction <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
there are not many, but i really really like them, even when not perfect. things are temporary, so it's not smart to keep complaining, right ?
by the way i really don't care about the reputation of the places on the internet, to be honest, so i'm always open to experiencing things before judging them by the contents that spread out there. for example, tumblr has a very dubious and embarrassing reputation, but i have used it for many years and absolutely love the beautiful and interesting content that i find exclusively there. people simply should try before saying anything.
</pre>
<br>
mm.. people can be very judgmental with some places on the internet without any real experience so i think it's fair to give my opinions about it !<br>
<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍪</sub><br>
what are you thinking of the new layout <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> ?<br>
this one is my favorite layout of all times.. i'm so proud ; ;<br>
i organized everything waaay better, getting rid of some unnecessary pages with repetitive content.. !<br>
now i just have my main project featured, all of my other works can be found here at the blog and the portfolio.<br>
i feel like everything is way better now <sub>🧸</sub><br>
<br>
so.. about my new social media i was starting to get.. well, too into it.<br>
but i know that social media are bad, it was making me feel really stressed already ; ;<br>
so i made a promise to myself : i will just open my apps once a day. i still want to keep my "5 hours of internet per week" but it obviously gets harder if i keep my apps open and distracting me !!<br>
this is what i'm doing now :<br>
after waking up i open the apps, i check and respond my friends, i post ( if i have something to post ), then i close the apps.<br>
sometimes i don't respond messages, if i'm tired.. and i try to plan my posts once a week, not every day ( but sometimes i'm just full of ideas )<br>
.. before sleep i like to respond the messages i haven't before, but that's about it !<br>
i'm doing it for some days now and i'm already feeling better <sub>📱</sub><br>
please be careful about social media ! it is good for making friends and reaching people with your work, but in balance. posting personal things and opening all your apps multiple times a day will only keep you increasingly far from individuality !!!<br>
you must have realized that you start thinking bad things that you would not normally think and feeling "out of place" ; it's because you're being influenced by excessive information.. !<br>
really dangerous ...<br>
<br>
talking about social media, last month i made a "mood calendar" for instagram, but this month i wasn't feeling motivated for that ..<br>
i see many similar calendars everywhere and i didn't see a reason in doing something repetitive like that, but i wanted to continue with that idea, improving it somehow.. !<br>
so i had the idea to do a "self care calendar", much more complete and useful <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
i'm very proud of it and i hope to have more ideas in the future to continue helping others on a daily basis.<br>
helping people is something i love, because it not just fills my heart with joy but also makes me emotionally stronger !<br>
i feel that i can help myself and people i love better if i've practice beforehand. my own advices and texts help me a lot, and i'm really glad to be able to share it with others and help in any way <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
i have been trying to fight against insecurity for the longest time.. just like everyone else.<br>
i think that discovering your individuality is the best way for understanding who you are, what are your flatters and what you can actually improve !<br>
accepting compliments with your heart is very hard, since you don't actually believe these. it doesn't mean they're wrong.<br>
lately i've been feeling particularly insecure about myself because sometime it seems that my personality is just the way it is because of the people i've met, which would mean that i also can change others .. isn't it impure ? wrong ?<br>
actually, i think that it's a natural process of maturing. since we really are shaped with time, it doesn't mean all of it is impurity.. !<br>
i'll write more about it on the q&a today.<br>
<br>
now, the first thing i have to post here is the backup of my latest html page !!<br>
it's a scenary collage with all of my favorite sprites of ragnarok online <sub>💗</sub><br>
aaand, of course, cute domain : <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://kafra.pooftie.me" target="_blank">kafra.pooftie.me</a><br>
( i've always admired the kafras, they are inspiration to me <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font> )<br>

<br>
mm i have some important things to write on the q&a text today, about the fragility of the ego.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
the ego is all that you were not naturally, all that you have consumed and learned from life experiences. the ego is not necessarily bad, but it is definitely dangerous..<br>
your ego is the cause of all your insecurities and social problems ; every time you feel dissociated or afraid of other people's opinion about you is because you're trying to make your ego stronger and protect it. the thing is .. you have nothing to be afraid of !<br>
no one can actually stole who you are, even if you feel like you're similar to others in some way of trying to replicate others to become better, it's just your way of learning. it may be not the best way of improving, but it's what you have now, so it's important being patient with yourself !!<br>
everything i've learned and got inspired by others is just what made me improve and mature, it's not a bad thing. i also believe that if i am inspiring others in a good way, it's a good thing !!<br>
it would be impure if i was changing who i am, but i am in fact just polishing myself. i can feel what is artificial and what is not ; so i trust myself to get inspiration and improve with time and experiences.<br>
i realize that overcoming this fear is really important, since it's really hurtful and hard to improve if i keep feeling afraid of trying new things, changing and not being approved by others.. !<br>
i can clearly see when people are truly giving me useful and important criticism, and when they're just trying to make me sad because they're frustrated with themselves. i still feel afraid of making people feel frustrated, but it's inevitable. bad feelings are also part of life, and i feel blessed for being able to feel these things and keep learning from it !!<br>
the ego keeps making me think that i should protect my individuality and my beliefs, that if someone dislike me it's because i'm making something wrong, they're trying to make me unmotivated.. and they're getting it .<br>
this is really bad, i now can see that it's natural if i make mistakes, even if i'm not making mistakes someone will not agree with me, everyone interpret things differently. i just hope people keep growing up and learning.. and they are !<br>
individuality is not something that can be stolen, your ego may seem artificial sometimes but if you keep your purity and just do things that you want from heart, everything is okay <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
who you are is not just visuals, musical tastes, mannerisms .. you're actually really unique, since ever. no one is truly similar to you, at all ! maybe similar to your ego, but it keeps evolving anyways. it is important to be able to representate your personality through your ego, you can help others to understand themselves and feel really comfortable in your body if you learn to look and act how you think it's the best version of you. if you're not making up your ego for others but using it as a way of expressing yourself, it's healthy and valid !!<br>
embrace your actual perfection, within your abilities and reality <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
everyone is trying, and sometimes there will be mean people out there. you're strong enough for understanding they're just sad and immature, they don't actually care about you personally, if you did nothing wrong. your ego makes you fragile and easily offended, but you have nothing to be afraid of !<br>
these are some important reminders for you and i...<br>
everyone learns to keep their purity in different paces, so if someone can feel suddenly confused and unsatisfied with themselves by trying to copy who i am, it's not my fault .. i always try to make it clear that purity is important..<br>
i just want to be happy, and i want others to be happy too. i know that i must accept who i am and love myself to achieve happiness !<br>
<br>
<br>
please don't forget to give me feedback, suggestions and questions for future content <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>

hiii fluffies <sub>🐁</sub><br>
so many things have happened in last weeks .. i'm a little overwhelmed, even ; ;<br>
but i'm trying my best to rest and respect my relaxing time !!<br>
it's always hard keeping a routine and schedules, since my body and my mind not always agree with what i'm supposed to do.. but this is also part of a healthy routine !<br>
sometimes we need to adapt the schedule to respect our time and not get too tired.<br>
it's actually common for me to have a full lazy day and the next day i feel super motivated to do all tasks for three days.. !<br>
the important thing is to not pressure myself to follow the routine 100%, since it's supposed to be helpful and not a bother. if i'm doing my weekly tasks and resting properly, everything is ok !!<br>
<br>
so .. you may have noticed some very "drastic" changes in all my social media,,<br>
i was already making a sort of cleaning, but this time.. i just couldn't keep doing it.<br>
i decided to finally stop this pain and actually delete my accounts and make new ones !<br>
i have now new accounts for my "soft" project ; my social media accs <sub>💻</sub><br>
i mean, only my tumblr blogs are the same, but i changed urls !<br>
as you already know, i don't use social media for personal content but to post actual helpful stuff.. maybe not thaaat helpful but i always try to post things that can be inspiring, motivational or just make someone's day a little better <sub>🌷</sub><br>
my old accounts were not really making this project work very well.. but well, i'll write more about this in the q&a !<br>
<br>
it took me a while to know what i should post on my new instagram acc, since i would like it to be something original and helpful ..<br>
i was thinking of using it as a "spam" acc, but my posts ended up being more helpful than i expected,, so it ended up becoming a "self care" acc !<br>
my posts are all stuffies and the next slides are screenshots from the "help" page of my site ( yes, thiiis one )<br>
i always wanted these tips to reach more people, and since i have to post something on my feed anyway, this was a good way for me to actually help more people !!<br>
<br>
i'm proud of my progress .. ; ;<br>
my acc is full of friends and mutuals that i love very much.. ! many precious and sweet people. <sub>🍮</sub><br>
i want to keep it a healthy and safe environment there. i want to motivate them to be happier and feel valid !!<br>
<br>
i also started doing "story games" and even a "mood calendar" to entertain everyone while helping them with self improvement !<br>
i used the "small moments" once and the "mood calendar" for a week, but i don't think i'll continue using them myself since i'm making a new diary where i'll write things down in a more private way <sub>🗝</sub><br>
modesty aside, i honestly think my story posts became much prettier than i expected ..<br>
and i'm so happy because my aesthetic is inspiring other people !!<br>
i always feel my heart warm when i see that people are being inspired by me <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<br>
so, today, the text will be about this renewal of my internet life !<br>
a complement to a text i've written before, about "numbers".<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
social media have created this need for big numbers in people and i feel that i don't have reasons to keep seeing numbers than to praise a false reputation for my image on the internet. i'm just a normal person doing my best, just like any other person. i reflected a lot on this and people treating me differently because of numbers is not something that i value and i don't think is good for me or the visitors. the race for numbers and fame is not the kind of thing i'd be proud to encourage on my site ( or anywhere else, but unfortunately that's not always an option, hence why i avoid social media so much ).<br>
i used to keep numbers exposed despite not approving their overvaluation because i believed it could bring public ; maybe people could took me more seriously if i had big numbers ? maybe they could allow themselves to look at the site more easily if they saw this "seal of approval" from previous visitors ?<br>
.. but is it really worth blinding people with such superficial information and then saying it's not important ?<br>
i have come to the conclusion that i must be an example and show that appreciation of numbers is not healthy or productive.<br>
i felt free from this race for numbers as i started moving away from social media, and i discovered over time that frequent visitors of my site are not here either by the numbers, but by the content, just as they are on other interesting sites and blogs of the internet. it definitely warms my heart to know that my work honestly attracts so many people <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
it's extremely invigorating to be free of ego needs and social fears.<br>
hiding numbers and keeping written feedback is more productive for everyone. i wish from the bottom of my heart that people would exchange more real interaction, not in the form of numbers, but words and actions.<br>
i'm little by little getting more and more clean of the "numbers", and it's making me feel really good and refreshed.. !<br>
now i'm trying to get rid of all of my social media with big follower numbers. yes, i did my best there, i spent time and effort posting content, but now it's time to refresh things.<br>
i was just really tired of all of this.. random strangers following me just because of a random viral post, creeps messaging me, my accs turning to feel important and platforms treating it like nothing.. so stressful !!<br>
i writed my reasons, and i honestly think these changes are an improvement for me and the quality of my content <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
even if not using social media for posting personal content, it's still the best way to reach people and make friends. this is what i wanted, from the begin, and just now i'm being able to actually reach people's hearts !<br>
the thing is,, my accs with lots of random people and artificial interactions were consuming my patience and time and i couldn't actually interact with others because it wasn't even safe to try approaching them ; i want to have more time for healthy relationships and for myself.<br>
on my own websites i am more spontaneous and helpful to others, i can make friends and approach people safely, i am able to interact with my friends and be there for everyone who needs me, i can support people i admire and i want it to be soft !! i want my life to be softer, in general.<br>
i'm happy to say that this is becoming reality <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
i'm ironically being able to reach a higher number of people now than before, not with just cute stuff but my feelings too, and i believe it's because i'm doing better and being more sincere. i now can say i truly care about every single people that interact with my posts, because i can actually enter their accs and see they're trying their best too !!<br>
my large accounts always had infinitely less interactions than the number of followers, which means that obviously many of those accounts were inactive or people who didn't even care about who they're following. i don't want it anymore. i want real people, a comfortable and safe ambient for me and everyone ! the internet can be a place full of illusions. i believe the numbers are one of the most dangerous illusions.<br>
i feel lighthearted now, as i'm being able to communicate with others better and doing what i wanted from the begin : reaching your hearts and soften your feelings !<br>
i feel softer now.. i'm happy life made me see how artificial and unnecessary all these numbers are. i learned that real people are important ; kind and lovely people, who will be there. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
and i will be there, too ! even with the distance, i am here.<br>
<br>
i hope i can inspire you to improve your internet life, too..<br>
is it really healthy and safe for you, right now ?<br>
<br>

i hope this year is full of happy memories for all of us <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i took a while to have the energy to do this post, i'm in a bad phase ; ;<br>
summer is a hard time for me, especially when it comes to sleep ..<br>
my sleep routine is a mess, i'm tired all day <sub>🥛</sub><br>
i want to improve it.. i want to feel more energetic so i can do my projects !!<br>
<br>
anyway, i'm feeling happy <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i went through some sad moments but with the support of my loved ones i was able to overcome all this and to learn many things <sub>🍰</sub><br>
i know all difficulties are important because it's with them that we face problems, fears and insecurities and we improve !!!<br>
if you are going through something hard now, remember this.. everything will be better soon !<br>
<br>
i have today to show you a collage and little melody that i'm very proud of !!<br>
i've been saving images with this aesthetic for a loooong time, i love this theme of strawberries and hearts <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>

valentine's day is coming so red and pink are important colors at the moment !!!<br>
don't forget to use this time to spread love and take care of yourself <sub>💗</sub><br>
<br>
lately for being with low energy, i didn't do many things ; ;<br>
but i'm super into dress up games, so i spent a lot of time playing with them <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
these entertain me for hours ..<br>
<br>
for finishing the post.. a q&a text about "my role in life" <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
the meaning of things is usually something melancholy to think about, since although things all happen with a reason, these reasons are so vague and neutral that they don't satisfy us. things happen because they need to happen, but they can be painful and it's impossible to stop the pain. for example, we feel sad if we are lonely, but we also feel sad if we love people and they are gone ( and one day they will ). it's inevitable.<br>
but i don't like to think of things in a pessimistic way, so i've always focused on something that i call "my role in life". this is what i must fulfill and that is what motivates me every day. it's something very simple, but at the same time so complicated.. to be happy.<br>
nothing in life makes sense if you're not happy, but anything and everything becomes magical if you feel happy. it doesn't really matter if that was fate or not, if happiness is just chemical produced by your brain, because the feeling is magical and welcoming. all good feelings : excitement, comfort, satisfaction, passion.. all of them are the goals in our lives. if nature has given us such good feelings to encourage us to keep going, i believe that is what we should do.<br>
i realized that to achieve my happiness i must have a pure heart, full of love.. i need innocence to enjoy all the wonderful little things of life in complitude. if i had been born in different living conditions, with another DNA, i certainly would not be the one i know today. i would not have learned or experienced the same things, so i would be someone else ; but that doesn't diminish for me the importance of purity. it's not about fitting into some pattern of pure and perfect angel, but rather embracing with all your heart all that your life has offered you until today and thereby forming your personality in the most positive way possible. every single person have purity, every one may be the best within one's own existence.<br>
something that makes me truly happy is to be able to teach how to be the best version of yourself, spreading happiness, love and sharing everything i've learned to this day. although i can't reach many people, although i can't really interfere with their lives and make them happy, i do my best. i want to continue to the end of my life being as happy as i can and helping other people as much as i can, especially the ones i love.<br>
some people will never learn to be happy, some people will never truly love. perhaps, the life given to them did not bring enough opportunities. maybe they just have a different way of seeing life. i believe it doesn't matter the way you see things, your personality or your appearance, for these are just consequences of your life, easily moldable. what matters is that inside your heart you can feel the warmth and magic that is love. if you love, you can become better, there is hope ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
mm i'd like to thank you, if you really read everything i write ..<br>
it means a lot to me ; ; <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
my love & appreciation is my valentine's day gift for you this year ..<br>
<br>
