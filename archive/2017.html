hiiii fluffies <sub>🤍</sub><br>
merry xmas !!!!! <sub>🍰</sub><br>
my ult fav holiday, the time of year when i get listening to all ragnarok christmas bgm ( which i suggest to all of you, since it's what most helps me to get the christmas spirit )<br>
i think i never told you, but one of my biggest dreams is to see snow. i've NEVER seen snow, since where i live it doesn't snow.<br>
it may seem crazy to you, but it's true, and it makes me extremely sad that i never had a christmas with winter and snow !!<br>
in fact, summer has just arrived, and it is certainly about 30°C right now ...<br>
but the christmas spirit and a lot of ice cream always helps me feel better !<br>
i know that one day i will have a traditional christmas in the northern hemisphere, since my desire is to live there in some years.<br>
but that's a story for another post <sub>🦋</sub><br>
<br>
so, i'm having some personal problems and it's difficult to make my shop items and organize everything ! besides that there are still some materials missing ...<br>
but i hope i'll be able to make my online store a reality by next year !<br>
<br>
coming back to christmas, i received a lovely gift from bubu : the paper doll mate coloring book <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
you know how much i love coloring cute drawings, and this book is something i was really longing for. i'm so happy !!!<br>
it's definitely the cutest coloring book i've ever seen in my life, and i'm super excited to get started <sub>💝</sub><br>
i've been looking for scanned pages of this book because i didn't want to paint it only once, i wanted to be able to paint as much as i wanted ( even digitally )<br>
as i didn't find anything, i decided to scan all the coloring pages myself, so the book can be perfect forever, as i can print the pages as many times as i want !<br>
<br>
now, i would like to talk about this subject that has bothered me a lot on the internet because people are saying very rude things about each other just like a chain of hate ; ;<br>
this makes me very sad, and i feel that it's important spread positivity about it, although it is complicated to write about, i hope you understand my point :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
( before starting, i would like to point out that in referring to boys and girls i mean the natural female and male sides of people, such as the sєxes ! )<br>
<br>
humans are animals, above all else. and animals are born boys or girls, to procreate and fulfill their roles in nature.<br>
human beings are rational animals, so sometimes we are not satisfied with what we're born from. our heart is pure and knows what is best for us, and we must be happy to make others happy.<br>
therefore, we can choose our role in nature ( and society, of course )<br>
but there is something very bad that affects our choices of heart that would make us happy and good : people choose what they are, what they like, their way of living and their roles in society, based on what others think is cool !<br>
this is an impure thought, for we should not change who we truly are only because "it's cool", we must be pure, be ourselves above all else.<br>
there is some kind of odious fashion where it says girls should live with the goal of being better than boys, and vice versa.<br>
and there is also another one that boys have built up today's society alone, and that girls have never helped at all.<br>
this is a very toxic thought that affects our lives and society, we should not be against each other !!<br>
<br>
boys and girls are no better than others, just different. biologically, we have some advantages and disadvantages over the other, but this is natural and there is nothing wrong.<br>
we are like cake and pudding, there is no better or worse, just personal preference !<br>
therefore, we can be who we really want, because our heart knows the right way.<br>
a society works well and happy when everyone is pure, are themselves, and so can fulfill their roles in society, happy and comfortable with their lives !<br>
the role of all people in society is to do good, to spread love and kindness, to bring education and health to others and to be happy. this can be done by all people when they are living stable and comfortable lives!<br>
you don't have to have children or form a family for it, if you don't want to, even if nature has made your body for it. what matters is meeting and knowing who you really are. if you feel confused, you are not happy and you do not make others happy.<br>
if you feel that getting married, having children and caring for the house would make you happy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, of course !<br>
even if your friends tell you that it would make you dependent and unhappy, does not mean it's true. economic independence is not really independence in life.<br>
people seek a happy society for all through toxic thoughts of superiority. we must work together as a family ! when we are together, the advantages and disadvantages of being a boy or girl does not matter, as they can complement each other in solving problems !<br>
we all have special abilities and unique talents. it may be difficult to find what we want to be and do in our lives, but it's very important that we do not follow the instincts or opinions of others, but the heart, which is who we certainly are.<br>
<br>
<br>
i'm sorry if i wrote many things repeated, i hope you can understand !<br>
i hope this has some good feeling for you, because the internet is full of people fighting over being better than the other and this makes me very upset ...<br>
<br>

hiii fluffies <sub>💗</sub><br>
i now have custom domains and ssl for my tumblrs !!<br>
i'm so happy about it, i managed to keep everything 100% covered with ssl, and i changed all the links, for the consistency.<br>
and now i've also put some html files online : the html tester ( test.pooftie.me ), the offline ywot ( txt.pooftie.me ) and also a new page of unicode text converters ( utf8.pooftie.me ) !<br>
i like collecting unicodes, and there are some "unicode fonts" that few people know about and i think it's cool to share ! these converters were made by me for easier use.<br>
i had doubts between using tumblr or github to host those files, and i chose github.<br>
the domains are so lovely, right ? <sub>🧸</sub><br>
<br>
well, about links, there's something i need to say, even if people don't really seem to care about it, i do care :<br>
i like to put links the right way: if it's http, i put http, if it's https, i put https, if it's www, i put www, if it's not www, i don't put www. i do that for all the links i put, everywhere, because i think this is the right thing to do ; i don't want people to click on a link that is different from the reality, i don't think it's right.<br>
i just wanted to say this to keep you informed of this issue.. let's organize links better, internet <sub>💻</sub><br>
<br>
as i said in the last post, this post will be very special, so i have here also a piano composition :<br>

although i quite like kins and ids, i am sincerely afraid to get involved in dramas since the community is often toxic, so i don't usually expose this kind of thing. but since you were interested to know, i'll show you some of my lovely comfort characters !<br>

　　　　　( there's more, you can ask )<br>
<br>
i really don't define them as ids because it's a little complicated to do that, but i can say i identify with them a lot & they are really heartwarming for me !<br>
that being said, i don't care at all if you like them too.<br>
actually, i don't feel that doubles ever make people invalid, but i think it's always okay to seek comfort, right ? i just can't agree with people being mean with each other ; ;<br>

as you can see, i did a new layout !!<br>
i planned to do this layout for next year, but i had problems with the server and would have to readjust all the pages for the new one, so i took the opportunity to finish the layout right now.<br>
i hope you are enjoying it, i updated several pages with new content and refined the portfolio <sub>🍮</sub><br>
now, i'm using github, which has a good reputation and is very interesting to use, even because my site is static so i don't need complicated tools to edit it.<br>
<br>
well, these days i felt like coloring a lot. i'm having a lot of fun watching my progress :<br>

halloween is coming, is coming !! <sub>🎃</sub><br>
( a little sad here because living in the southern hemisphere is awful, it's spring now, super anticlimatic )<br>

and how is your halloween going to be like ? <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
sooo, i made a new flash game for milky woods !<br>
this time i got the urge to draw only teddies, but i promise the next one will be different LOL<br>
i decided to deactivate my dA account, i was pretty inactive there ...<br>
because of my inactivity, i never bothered to become a core, and my profile was pretty messed up for some time. recently, i have slightly customized, editing texts, avatar and gallery, so it was cute, but really, i don't have much to do there.<br>
maybe you noticed that i'm deactivating some inactive accounts, and that's because i'm trying to get rid of unnecessary social media ; ;<br>
the accounts that i keep online but inactive, is because i use them to keep contact with some people !<br>
i don't keep contact with anyone specifically on dA, so i think it's for the best to just deactivate.<br>
don't worry, i'm still going to make flash games, but post them here !!<br>
if you came here from my dA account, i'm sorry for the inconvenience, you can still play all the games right <a href="https://poofties.club/games" target="_blank" id="linkbjinho">here</a><br>
aaand, here is the little game :<br>

please tell me what you think !! <sub>⭐</sub><br>
<br>
today, i would like to talk about something that would be interesting, since some of you know me through the poofties projects' accounts and games, or even before that.<br>
before i create the name "middlepot" :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
what did i do on the internet before starting the projects and this website ?<br>
some of you have known me for quite some time because i played many online games, especially dress up games and ragnarok. i'm not going to get into this because i already have the gaming session, where you can check it out !<br>
i started with the internet very early, i was only 7 years old ( 2004 ). my mom always saw everything i did, so it was safe, don't worry LOL<br>
i used to play flash games, and i had msn, and a blog. everyone had blogs or personal websites on the internet, where they customized and posted all sorts of things. i was a kid so i was not good with those things, but i liked to post gifs with cute animals, lots of glitter and beautiful images that i found on other blogs and google.<br>
i didn't have social media at the time because i was very young and my mom wouldn't let me. i enjoyed visiting lots of websites with graphics and materials, beautiful blogs, and playing online games. my first online game was ragnarok, and my second, club penguin, if you wanna know.<br>
i only used the internet for 2 hours a day in the morning and i used this time to decorate my blog and play with my friends. it was so much fun and i have great memories of that time !<br>
i could have a social media ( orkut ) with 9 y/o, and i continued just posting cute graphics with lots of glitter, because it's just so adorable !<br>
i also knew several forums at that time, and began to communicate with people all over the world. my english was obviously horrible, but i used the google translator to help me. i never posted any real information or photo because i was taught that this is dangerous.<br>
i made several blogs, which were improving the quality of content and the layouts were becoming cuter. in 2006, i made the first layout that i really was proud of !<br>
<br>
over time, the internet has been changing .. the blogs became unpopular, forums too, msn died, orkut died.. very sad, right ? ;;<br>
i then looked for substitutes for the things i liked : i tried using facebook to replace orkut, but no one else cared about the glittery cute things and i was disappointed.<br>
i started using tumblr, which was well customizable and could fill the void that blogs left behind. it worked, even if it took a long time to find an aesthetic that would make me really happy, so i did several blogs until i got to my recent one ( it was during this time that i created the name middlepot ).<br>
my recent one, was done together with a friend of mine, who also made with me the not bad fb page, which should have the same aesthetics. but she and i had very different opinions of what we wanted to do and she'd post things that i didn't like, both on the tumblr and on the page ... it became a mess, and we ended up giving up doing it together. i'd like to talk more about it in another post, because it's a tricky subject ; ;<br>
anyway, i deleted her posts from tumblr and facebook, and then i got to my actual project : safety & comfort !<br>
i no longer use fb and decided to continue the project by keeping just the necessary accounts, separately :<br>
tumblr is my place to post images in original quality ; youtube is my place to make playlists ; twitter is my place to post ascii art ; instagram is my place to post interactive content .<br>
i don't use any social media in a very personal way because these are just for sharing content to inspire and make people smile with positivity !<br>
it was hard deciding what i should do, i'm used to the more open and customizable format the old internet had... tumblr is the place where i most adapted, but i still don't use it to post personal content.<br>
to replace the forums, i found other places on the internet where i could communicate with various types of people, where i always remain anonymous as usual.<br>
to replace msn, which was the platform i always used to talk to my family and close friends, i decided to use line. line in my opinion resembles quite a lot of things, besides having super cute stickers and themes !!<br>
i also decided to try out discord because of friends, who use it a lot.. it reminds me of the oldschool group chats, so i like it.. !<br>
now line is my fav chatting app,, while discord is my fav for group chat, specifically.<br>
<br>
but in spite of having some social media accs, other nice places on the internet & the cute line... i was still missing something, my little corner on internet, to be able to make layouts exactly as i imaginate & post every kind of things i want : a personal website !!<br>
so i did it, and here i am <sub>💝</sub><br>
the 7 y/o me would be really proud of everything i'm doing right now. this website is really my favorite place on internet !<br>
it's all i wanted, here i can put together all the projects i do and all the content i like.<br>
sadly, personal websites are not that popular nowadays, so if i want to really help people in some way i need to keep some social media accounts for reaching them ..<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this answers a few things about how i got here ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
and i wrote a lot, i hope it's not tiring to read ; ;<br>

things in my life are complicated at the moment, so don't be surprised by my brief absences !<br>
i hope to start the store and improve some projects by next year.<br>
about the frequency of blog posts, which are not exactly weekly, i'm trying to write posts as often as i get lots of good ideas for the q&a, but the plan is to keep the posts monthly, okay ? other pages, such as the status one, i will update more frequently.<br>
<br>
umm, as you know, i'm addicted to teddy bears. i honestly try to draw other things, but when i realize it, it's already a teddy bear. and also, bees, because i love bees !!<br>

no idea of when i could use this one.. maybe a little game ?<br>
<br>
for today's post, i will write about a subject that in fact, was the first request made here !<br>
since it's very complicated, this took a while to think about :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
do i age regress ? am i part of a community ? am i in a relationship with a "caregiver" ?<br>
<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> well, i don't think i really age regress because i don't enter a "mind space", but i do have lots of "small" personality traits & interests.. it makes my heart soft, it's part of who i am and i believe i should embrace it ♡<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> as i don't age regress, i am not part of any community,, but i identify with babycore and age regression blogs because it always make me feel so comfy & soft ! i always keep following this kind of content.<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> i consider bubu ( my love ) my caregiver in some way, because he takes good care of me since i'm very sensitive and get anxious about complicated "adult stuff", he always helps me a lot, keep me safe and i love him so much !!! ♡<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> i recently realized.. i am a platonic caregiver ! i love taking care of others, but it's not in a romantic way.. so it's different from what bubu is for me. i also don't enter any kind of "mind space" in this case !<br>
<br>
<br><br>
now, about agє play, ddIg / cgI .. there is a fine line between pedσphilia and those kιnks. how to identify dangerous situations, dangerous people, what's the limit ?<br>
i think the sєx life between two adults, responsible for themselves, with consent, is something that opens doors to things like kιnks or lifestyles such as bdsм being legal. in my opinion, kιnks should in no way be publicly exposed, on the streets or on the internet, where children can see and be influenced. children can't have contact with these kind of things because it wouldn't be healthy. having a ηsfw account on a public social media website where children can easily join is irresponsible, even more so if it involves controversial things that can be dangerous for minors.<br>
this unfortunately is something that has happened very often, and even worse, added to agє play : ddIg / cgI has reached many minors and many adult pedσphiles have had contact with these children through kιnk communities.<br>
these communities have become increasingly dangerous for minors, through the romanticization of pedσphilia, child abusє and contact with kιnks linked to childhood. even people who claim to be in a sfw ddIg / cgI community are not safe and are exposed to dangerous people as they use kιnk tags.<br>
communities of age regression that work hard to be a truly safe environment for people who don't use the agere as something sєxual, are anti ddIg. many people have gone against this kιnk, because of exposure to minors. it has become something horrible and manipulative, and i agree that it is deeply problematic.<br>
<br>
it is really very dangerous to associate childhood with sєxuality in any case, even if those involved are adults, and i firmly believe that kιnks shouldn't be publicly exposed for children to see. neither of them.<br>
the only way to keep a kιnk safe and not harmful to anyone is avoiding all possible public exposure, and stop sєxualizing childhood. i don't see how people can think this is okay..<br>
i hope i have made things clear, since this subject is so controversial, it's difficult to write about it<br>
if i said something wrong, please let me know !<br>
i'm open to suggestions, as always, so don't forget my email : <i>letters@middlepot.com</i><br>

the weather is surprisingly hot for an early spring, and even so i'm eating a lot of sweets...<br>
it usually happens on cold days <sub>☕️</sub><br>
the heat makes me pretty lazy, so i'm having trouble keeping my tasks up to date ; ;<br>
i'm trying very hard <sub>🍄</sub><br>
by the way, now i think i can respond everyone's messages properly !!<br>
hmm, i'll be here probably once a week ? i like to have a week routine and i would not be able to be available to write to you every day ..<br>
<br>
so, here is a very short song that i didn't do recently, but i suddenly found on my things, and i'm so happy because i thought i had lost it forever !!<br>

<br><br>
what do you think ? i really like it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
cello is definitively my favorite instrument..<br>
i wish i could keep doing classes, but well i'm focusing on other things now <sub>🐕</sub><br>
<br>
now, after having been asked a lot about it in the past weeks, i have a complicated topic to write about :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
self diagnosis. deductions based on internet searches are safe ?<br>
i am not against this kind of research, for it's necessary that we know ourselves to seek appropriate help. it is not safe to be silent about our problems.<br>
consulting a professional without being aware of what we feel may result in an uncertain diagnosis. professional help will only be complete with our help, too !<br>
but, it is very important to know that it's completely unsafe to get conclusions about our health without consulting professional help, especially at the time of medication. self medication is something extremely dangerous that can make our problems worse.<br>
<br>
talking about our mental health can be a good thing when it comes to interacting with people because they can hurt us unintentionally. we need to talk about it with people we interact with.<br>
on the internet it has become common for people to make dx lists, to try to stay safe.<br>
there is a serious controversy about this as lots of people use self dx to have the freedom to treat people rudely.<br>
mental illnesses are not justification for doing evil. mental illnesses that affect the personality and make a person have bad attitudes are very serious and should be treated, you know ?<br>
people who use the name of illness to feel more special than others are extremely disrespectful, you should be careful when writing this kind of thing as a way of protection.<br>
<br>
personally, i think dx lists can be dangerous because people are bad and can use it against you.<br>people may think that you are pretending, or try to affect your weaknesses. i think this type of exposure requires caution.<br>
<br>
about me, i can't say i am not neurotypical, because i never had a dx, and i'd rather not do a self dx...
i am searching for it, because i think it's important.<br>
this is what i can say for now :<br>
<br>
 <sub>📍</sub> i am very very sensitive. i don't trust people easily and i don't make friends easily ; but i do have some people that i know i can trust, and they make me happy and safe around them. this makes me happy because i consider myself pretty much an introvert.<br>
<br>
 <sub>📍</sub> i do have problems with socializing, and i feel very anxious and i can't breath properly when i'm around lots of unknown people, specially if they are looking at me and if i'm alone. i feel better when i have someone i can really trust with me, but i usually don't put myself in unconfortable situations.<br>
<br>
 <sub>📍</sub> i had bad experiences at home, some people from my family are not good for me and made me feel very awful things. my mom is a good person and i love her, but my relationship with her has been quite distant since i grew up.<br>
<br>
 <sub>📍</sub> about some bad experiences i do not have clear memories. sometimes in bad situations, i lost consciousness. from time to time i have bad dreams about uncomfortable experiences. even though they happened many years ago, they always seem to be in my memory, and i hate it.<br>
<br>
i deal with these problems avoiding situations that make me uncomfortable.<br>
since i work and study at home and i have no contact with my past fears, i don't have much problems anymore.<br>
still, my trauma nightmares keep coming from time to time. i'm afraid that people can force me to uncomfortable situations, all by myself.<br>
i try to take care of myself the best i can. i hope to get a dx soon, because i feel it can help me to cope.
<br>
<br>
well, that's it !<br>
i wouldn't like to receive messages about the situations i mentioned, or deductions about my health, because i think it would be uncomfortable... thank you !<br>
i hope this post has helped someone <sub>🩹</sub><br>

hiii fluffies <sub>🌷</sub><br>
spring is coming where i live !<br>
but the weather is super weird, so i ended up with the flu all week <sub>💊</sub><br>
( i'm getting better now, don't worry )<br>
<br>
the site is getting more and more visitors, and i'm receiving so many messages !!<br>
that's really great, but it's hard to answer all of you individually ; ;<br>
but i promise to keep up with your messages, just give me some time !<br>
just remembering : you can send emails whenever you want to <i>letters@middlepot.com</i><br>
including questions and suggestions for the site and blog posts <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
i received an interesting question by email from a person who was wondering which tool i use to test html.<br>
well, i've always been used to testing html directly on the internet, because there were lots of sites with "html testers". after observing some, I was able to create my own "html tester" which consists of a very simple code !<br>
i realized that nowadays this is not very common, so, since it's very cute and functional, i think it would be nice to share with you !<br>
the link is " test.pooftie.me " <sub>🗝</sub><br>
it's basically a text box where you put the code, and when testing, it opens a popup with the result.<br>
<br>
well that's it for today !!<br>

i'm so excited about the progress of the site,<br>
it's already reached a thousand hits !! <sub>💻</sub><br>
i have a lot of plans for the projects, so don't worry, none of them will be stuck.<br>
as you may have noticed, i am addicted to teddy bears.<br>
really, i draw stuffies everywhere <sub>🐑</sub><br>
some of my future projects will be stuffie themed, so keep an eye open !<br>
<br>
some of you know, i sometimes use the website " yourworldoftext.com ", for sharing cute ascii art and unicodes.<br>
based on other versions, i created my own version of this site, but offline. you can test things here and create little worlds. i have an exported page, so you can test how the process of importing and exporting worlds works :

<br>
so, let's get down to the subject i want to talk about :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
on tumblr, it's very common to see specifications of what kind of aesthetics and content you post and what kind of people you accept interaction with. some of you are curious about my specifications and ask in my tumblr, which is related to my main facebook page too, since the aesthetics are similar.<br>
so here i am to clarify some things about the aesthetics that i post on my main tumblr, and what kind of blogs i usually follow and interact :<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i usually follow blogs with nostalgia, babycore, dollcore, webcore, angelcore, cottagecore, cleancore, vintage stuff, anything that is comfy and cute for me, because i make my blog a safe space.<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> my tumblr is not a kin blog nor an age regression blog and i am not part of any community, but i interact with age regression blogs from sfw communities. i don't usually interact or accept interactions with kιnk blogs, because these people can be dangerous.<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> sometimes, i follow trauma blogs. they have negative content from time to time and even nsfw content, but i don't usually interact with that kind of content, just the posts i consider related to what i'm feeling at the moment. trauma blogs sometimes make me feel comfortable and helps me deal with bad memories.<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i interact and follow blogs with nudity, usually renaissance paintings, which i love so much ! i don't interact with pσrn blogs, and i usually block the ones i consider wrong.<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i consider my blog really sfw, unless you consider artistic nudity and some small bruises nsfw. i make sure to use tags, so you can hide specific things. so please be careful about body image, gifs, bruises, religious images, medicine, bugs, dolls and other triggers. everything i've quoted is posted cautiously and infrequently + my blog is drama-free !<br>
<br>
<br>
i think this is enough to clarify your doubts !<br>
about self diagnostic, kιnks and other controversial issues, i'll talk about it in the near future.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this post has been helpful in some way <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
see you next week !<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍓</sub><br>
i'm extremely happy with the progress of this site, you seem to be enjoying it a lot ; ;<br>
as you seem to be still exploring the site, new content will be added to the pages gradually.<br>
at the moment i'm dealing with the shy bunny store preparations <sub>🖋</sub><br>
many items are being made, but i want them to be a surprise so i'll keep it a secret for now. after the store's announcement, new items will always be shown here !<br>
it might take a while though.. i'm dealing with a lot of things lately, but i'm trying my best to keep up with my projects <sub>🔒</sub><br>
<br>
since i was talking about lσlιta fashion recently, there is something very important that i would like to clarify in this post !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
why do i use the word "lσlι" ?<br>
i feel it's very important to talk about the meanings of that word, and also of "nymρh". it has become a taboo to use these words, and since ever, the lσlιta (ロリータ) fashion has been bothered by the other meanings of that word.<br>
recently, things like "nymρhet aesthetic" are popping up. where do these words come from ?<br>
are these things connected ?<br>
<br>
so, beginning with lσlι, which is the abbreviation for lσlιta :<br>
it is impossible to know where the word lσlιta really came from. well before Nabokov, even Lewis Carrol already used that word.<br>
some people say it's just a nickname for lola, and that's it. it's a name, indeed.<br>
but not just a name, it has become a word full of meanings.<br>
i was able to gather 3 main meanings for this word, which can clarify some things for you all :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　lσlι/ta : a cute little girl, pure and innocent. this meaning has absolutely no sєxual connotation. it's the meaning i use to describe adorable little girls. it's very probably the meaning that was the basis for lσlιta (ロリータ) fashion, although it is not intended for little girls, the silhouette is based on the clothes of little girls of the Victorian and Rococo eras, especially in some sub-styles, like the sweet lσlι.<br>
　Ⅱ.　lσlι/ta : a girl who looks younger than she really is, like a little girl, in appearance, or personality. this meaning was sometimes used in age regression and gave rise to a type of fashion related to age regression. however, despite being an adjective without sєxual connotation, it is often used sєxually in the pσrnographic industry and among kιnksters. because of this, became a dangerous term and stopped being used in safe communities.<br>
related to this meaning, there is also :<br>
　　　　　lσlιcon / lσlιta complex : a person who is attracted to girls who look like little girls. obviously this is very questionable, but not necessarily linked to pedσphilia. not yet.<br>
　Ⅲ.　lσlι/ta : a little girl, prepubєscent or adolescent girl who is attractive and sєxually responsive, sєxually precocious. now, that meaning, is what really makes it all so dark. and related :<br>
　　　　　lσlιcon / lσlιta complex : a person who is attracted to little girls. basically, a pedσphile.<br>
<br>
<b>important :</b> i don't know the origins of the word "shσta", but it's the equivalent for boys, in all cases above.<br>
<br><br>
now, the word nymρh, which is the abbreviation for nymρhet :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　nymρh/et : mythological creatures, close to the fairies. conceived of as beautiful maidens inhabiting the sea, rivers, woods, trees, mountains, meadows, and frequently mentioned as attending a superior deity. this meaning has no sєxual connotation.<br>
　Ⅱ.　nymρh/et : a beautiful or graceful young woman, a maiden, or a marriageable young woman.<br>
　Ⅲ.　nymρh/et : an attractive and sєxually mature young girl. due to the depiction of the mythological nymρhs as females who mate with men or women freely and without care, the term is often related to women who are perceived as behaving similarly. related, there's the term nymρhomania that was created by modern psychology as referring to a "desire to engage in human sєxual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant", nymρhomaniac being the person suffering from such a disorder. in this case, the term "faunIet" is the equivalent for boys.<br>
<br><br>
so, as you can see, those words can be used without sєxual connotation, but because of the other meanings, they become rather dangerous words. it is not safe to use them as tags for example, as they may attract bad people. you must be careful when using these terms, but it is possible, and it is not wrong. please, be careful !<br><br>
and as you already must be thinking, yes, there are some similar stuff and related subjects that i will talk about in future posts, because they are also very important :<br>
　ddIg, agє play & age regression ;<br>
　self-diagnostic & trauma blogs ...<br><br>
( don't worry, i'm not going to be mean to anyone here, these are just interesting topics to talk about )
<br><br>
that's it !<br>
i hope you enjoyed this post <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
first post ever <sub>💘</sub><br>
<br>
hiii fluffies <sub>🧸</sub><br>
middlepot.com is finally active, after a long year of preparation ; ;<br>
obviously this is too long time for creating such a simple layout, but the biggest problem was the college, which took up a lot of my time <sub>🎁</sub><br>
you are probably here because of my projects, where i shared this brand new website !!<br>
this layout was inspired by sites from the 2000s that i liked to visit, did you like it ?<br>
i'm going to change it from time to time !<br>
don't forget to look every little corner here, because there are so many pages !<br>
i want to create more interactive content in the future because i love web design and interactive websites. i have lots of plans !<br>
i want to make this site useful and fun for everyone, so please don't forget to leave your opinions and suggestions in the chat.<br>
<br>
hm, the projects are up to date, but the portfolio is not making me very happy.<br>
it was great to create one because i could see how i need to improve on things that i'm interested in doing <sub>🌹</sub><br>
it's hard to focus on so many things, but i like to fill my time doing nice stuff !<br>
i will be updating the projects every week, but i will tell you all the updates here in this blog.<br>
but now you will have many new things to see on this site !<br>
please send me ideas, and things that i can do.. and coloring pages, of course, heh<br>
i'm so excited !!! <sub>🍦</sub><br>
<br><br>
so, let's talk about something very important, which are the rules of the contact form :<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> please use english or portuguese. i will answer, but i can't promise i will speak properly ;<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> you can ask questions about what you want, and i will select every week an interesting and complex topic to answer in a q&a, because i like to discuss interesting subjects with you, and mainly clarify any doubts ;<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> i'll block who pretend to be someone else ( i can see your ip ), who send nsfw content and who say extremely rude and uncomfortable things ;<br>
 <sub>🖇</sub> if your message is not sent, you can try again at another time or send me an email directly ( letters@middlepot.com )<br>
<br><br>
for now, that's it !<br>
see you in the next post, with the first q&a.<br>
<br>
