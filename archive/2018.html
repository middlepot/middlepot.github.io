hiiiii fluffies <sub>🍓</sub><br>
do you have the xmas spirit ? <sub>🎁</sub><br>
i'm willing to bring this comfort and warmth to you through this post ♡<br>
as you know, where i live is summer right now, which is very anticlimatic ; ;<br>
i always have difficulties getting into the xmas mood,<br>
but i love the xmas SO much !!!!<br>
i always start to live it as soon as halloween is over ( i really love halloween too, by the way )<br>
one of my biggest dreams is to have a white xmas. i really hope for the day when i will have my first white xmas, and maybe, all the next ones too !<br>
the snow is something magical that i really need to see..
it's so important to me, i can't explain <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
i wish i could see nature in all its splendor, in its completeness...<br>
if you can have snow where you live, i know that you maybe is used it, but please enjoy this vision and live this experience having in mind that it is something really special !!<br>
<br>
changing the subject, i've been thinking a lot about how i take criticism into consideration, but i especially pay close attention to negative criticism..<br>
i really do believe these are very useful for my personal improvement,<br>
but i think i've begun to take generalized negative criticism into consideration, which is a no no <sub>🐇</sub><br>
for example, when people generally talk negative things about humans, girls, anything that applies to me, i keep evaluating my behavior to see if i'm doing these bad things too<br>
the problem is that even when i realize that i am not doing anything bad, at all, and that the comment was true but generalized, i still feel sad because the image of who i am is at first bad, right ?<br>
i think it's important for my maturation to realize that people's opinions can really be very negative about me at first, but if they are not true, i should not be worrying about it. it only hurts me.<br>
it's natural to people who generalize opinions and stereotype things and people, and if these are bad things, i naturally have to overcome them by myself, and not try to "clean the image" of all people, if after all, they are not doing their best too.<br>
i think this is an important lesson !!<br>
<br>
do you also evaluate your behavior frequently ?<br>
being the best that i can makes me very happy, but it's tiring when i'm being too strict with myself <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
i will focus on giving my best to give pride to those who know me.<br>
it's hard to think a lot, but i feel very lucky to be a person and be able to have my heart connected with those i love & with nature <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font><br>
i want my feelings to reach you, especially this xmas <sub>🎀</sub><br>
<br>
now i would like to show you a very special playlist that i made to enter the xmas mood :<br>
<br><br>


<center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsBmCEP2InOrIBoY7dgsGY2SUtA5pYtB2" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">꒰ my xmas playlist ꒱</a></center>
</font></font></font>
<br>

</font></font></font>
<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br>
i hope it can warm your hearts too <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
there are only songs that are really special to me and that bring me sweet memories !<br>
consider it as my present for you <sub>🌹</sub><br>
<br>
i would like to comment that i have received some line stickers recently, from bubu, and i feel so identified with them ! it's literally me !!!<br>
besides the appearance, i really always identified myself in some way with alice !<br>
i especially identify with the feeling of dissociation, lack of reality and irritability that she shows in the course of the story.<br>
i think my life was very marked by that, and it was a way for me to be able to understand who i really am and to deal with the world around me, while understanding what fantasies are and their power over reality !<br>
( okay, i may be going a little far )<br>
anyway, here she is :<br>

today, the q&a will not be double, but i hope you like the subject i chose !<br>

i always see people talking about the girls' rivalry very aggressively, as if girls hated and competed with each other all the time.. i've been thinking a lot about it because i've always seen rivalry in a positive way in my life, but it was not always positive. i think i've come up with an explanation about it that makes a lot of sense :<br>
to begin with, girls naturally rival each other, differently than boys do. boys also compete, but usually in more objective situations, as in a specific competition or at a specific point to achieve a goal. this type of competition is what we see in games, for example. it's frustrating if you lose, but however mature enough to deal with, that's okay ; it's nothing personal. this type of competition happens between boys and girls alike, but it is not the same as female rivalry.<br>
female rivalry is something very subjective, and that's exactly why it's so interesting, and productive. when girls compare themselves with others in an objective way, they feel sad and can feel envy, which is bad and destructive to self-esteem and relationships ; but this is just a wrong and immature way of dealing with female rivalry ! it doesn't have to be this way ; ;<br>
i've suffered comparing myself directly to other girls, but i've learned that healthy rivalry is when you compare yourself subjectively. all girls tend to have life goals that are naturally very subjective, which even they can't perceive. it's those kinds of goals that you couldn't write exactly in a list and just take some steps to get there - in fact, you might never get there - and that's extremely motivating ♡ !!!<br>
comparing yourself to other girls looking at them as inspirations and looking at their achievements as motivation is something that always makes me feel very happy and inspired to be a better girl as well. to be a better person. i feel extremely motivated when i meet a girl who has life goals similar to mine ( things like being a purer, gentler, wiser person ) and on the same level that i feel that i don't want to lose to her, i don't want to be behind her, i want to reach her !! just as i want to be free to follow my own path, not hers ; i want to be just as a good girl as she is, not to be exactly like her. i want to be myself, the best i can be. seeing other girls being the best they can be fills my heart with joy and i definitely consider them rivals ! i want them to get better every day, just like me ♡ !!<br>
the rivalry between girls is something wonderful and incredible, not for compare us objectively, but subjectively.<br>
<br>
do you fluffies agree on what i wrote ?<br>
please, give me your opinions and additions <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
i wish you all the most beautiful and peaceful xmas !!!<br>

i feel absolutely soft these days ~<br>
i have learned a lot about patience and self control, but mostly about self care !<br>
i'm pretty anxious when it comes to being productive, i'd say i'm almost addicted to that sense of accomplishment after having a busy day.<br>
the problem is that i always felt useless when i was in my spare time ; ;<br>
this is not healthy, so i'm trying my best to respect the free hours of my day as much as the working hours, after all, both are important <sub>🛏</sub><br>
i'm also feeling that i'm getting more and more free of the "physical" things... even though they really matter to me, i know that too much bonding to them emotionally makes me feel needy easily, which is not good at all !<br>
it is definitely essential to remember that the most important things are not physical, because naturally, what makes us feel like home is where our heart is, not our body <sub>💝</sub><br>
<br>
now i would like to show you a very round & extremely adorable little bunny that i felted :<br>

such a cute aesthetic, i adore it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
today, i'll write a double q&a text !<br>
first subject is about trauma coping issues, second one about virtual world issues.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅰ<br>
this subject is very specific but i feel i should express myself about it, since i see many people with weird and even disgusting kιnks, aesthetics or artistic expressions, justifying it as a way of "coping trauma". i don't particularly think it's completely wrong, but very controversial and dangerous.<br>
i follow some trauma blogs and i see many toxic people in this environment, as well as people who are harmed or treated bad for posting controversial stuff.<br>
any kind of trauma or sensitivity to some bad, disgusting, dangerous, ugly subjects in general can become an obstacle in people's lives. no one wants to feel dirty or bad. it is natural trying to deal with such experiences or thoughts ; trying to romanticize, normalize, or even sєxualizate. we want to see beauty and pleasure in ugly things so we don't feel rejection for them and for ourselves and our bad memories, but obviously we need to take responsibility for this type of action and specify the motives, inform people of the problems and risks and not treat as something cute and casual. it's not the kind of content you have the right to post anywhere or spread around the world, no matter how traumatized you are. you have NO RIGHT to bother other people with your confused and romanticized content.<br>
people usually deal with this sort of thing in the form of art, aesthetics and even kιnks, there are people who do ugly romanticized things to become their aesthetic and way of life as a way of coping with trauma. this is something natural and there is usually no intention to hurt someone, just to make things simpler ; the problem is that this kind of attitude should not be treated as something simple. people who do this kind of art, people who post on this kind of aesthetics, people who live such lives should not spread to the world what they do as if it were something beautiful and desirable. this type of content, which has "damaged innocence", are something very sensitive, that i support, because they have already helped me a lot, but within specific communities and treated properly, as something very delicate and dangerous.<br>
if you're not aware of what you're doing you can put yourself in danger situations intentionally to try to confront your fears and this is not at all healthy or acceptable, depending on your condition. this is one side where self diagnosis can be dangerous because you really can't handle extreme things in an extreme way without having proper help, but i've already written about that subject. i've also commented about how kιnks being treated as a cute and cool "aesthetic" and spread over the internet is a bad thing for influencing young people and being harmful to other people.<br>
when i say that these processes of romanticizing helped me, it is true, it helped me a lot at a time that i was feeling very insecure and dirty because of my sometimes weird, dangerous and controversial desires. i was embarrassed to talk to anyone about it and this kind of romanticized content helped me a lot to understand that i was not a bad person by feeling what i felt, but more importantly, i was educated to know that even though it was "normal" it was not necessarily a right thing to do, or something to be proud of. so it has always been a secret and helped me to mature. over time, i could better understand what i felt and separate harmful things from healthy ones, and so be able to have a better lifestyle ( please don't ask me details about it, it makes me very uncomfortable /// ). it would be extremely hypocritical if i said that romanticizing is always bad, i just think that caution and instructions for such content are fundamental, to prevent this from being a bad influence and worsen people's mental health.<br>
i don't think people really need to have gone through physical traumas to have the "right to coping", that's a very disrespectful opinion ; everyone has the right to overcome their fears and problems, the problem is that when you do it publicly and treat it as something soft and romantic, such as a "broken doll" or "fallen angel", other people are harmed because they will put themselves in danger intentionally and consequently end up traumatized as well.<br>
finally, again, i confirm that i don't think it's wrong to romanticize things or even sєxualize them if it makes you feel better, but it is something extremely personal and delicate that must be done with caution and with the notion that suffering is not nice. it may be poetically beautiful, interesting, but it's not something that anyone should desire as it's dangerous and harmful.<br>
and anyway, i think it's good to consult professional help to know if you are coping in a healthy way because each person has particularities when dealing with this type of thing ! please stay safe ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
as you know, i am very involved with the "virtual world". the internet is part of my life and many of my works are digital. even so, i highly value the caution in creating a "virtual identity" just as i think it's sorely primordial to avoid spending too much time on the internet and overvalue the virtual world.<br>
i learned over time that the virtual world may seem "perfect" and incredible, just as it very easily occupies our time ( often not free time ) and entertains us ; but it's also very limited, so it is not worth replacing your "real life" time.<br>
the internet can be very useful for learning new things, interacting with people from all over the world, personal improving, and even for sorts of important jobs and hobbies, which is why i love the internet and value it. but the internet can only stimulate our sight and hearing, and we have five senses. only real life can stimulate all five senses and bring us full life experiences full of sensations and feelings !!<br>
you can't eat freshly picked wild berries, you can't feel the scent of flowers, you can't pet a fluffy animal, you can't hug people you love over the internet. don't substitute your real time for the virtual, it's not worth it. the internet has many limitations, it is inferior in comparison.<br>
and just as all experiences are much more intense and wonderful in real life, you too can only be as perfect and better as possible in real life. the virtual identity that we create exists to allow us to introduce others who are far from us, we can put together the best visuals we can offer and we can also publish works and receive reviews and feedback, we can learn and improve ; but you really are much more special with all the details. your image and voice are not all you have to offer, you in real life are a complete person and if you focus on improving yourself as a whole and not only superficially, you can enjoy the virtual world and the world real in the best way possible : beneficial, fun and above all, healthy ♡ !<br>
<br>
these are subjects that i always see people having confused feelings about, and that also confused me a lot for several years ; ;<br>
it's the kind of thing that gets in the way of our personal development, so i really hope that my texts are useful to you in some way <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>💕</sub><br>
i have great news for you : i decided that i will learn how to sew clothes, like my mom !!<br>
yes, i really want to improve my seamstress skills now.<br>
i decided this when thinking about the topic of fashion and how i love designing my own clothes.. and i don't really know how to sew clothes.<br>
i don't want to depend on my mom forever to sew my clothes and put ideas into practice, so i've decided that i will learn seriously !<br>
i'll start with simple clothes for myself, but as soon as i become more confident i want to sew more complex clothing <sub>👚👜</sub><br>
so you will see cute clothes and purses here in the near future <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
i'm really excited for this, i know it will be a big improvement for me <sub>🌷</sub><br>
my mom is encouraging me a lot and will teach me all the techniques !<br>
it's time to overcome the apprehension with sewing machines... wish me luck <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
well, for showing today, i have here a colorful, nostalgic and super cute collage !!<br>

<br>
nooow, of course, double q&a !<br>
i wrote very positive and motivating texts this time, the first one is about a positive world view, the second one is about self care.<br>
i wonder if these motivational texts actually help in any way and are not just "temporary positive energy"<br>
i struggle to follow my own advice, if you want to know... it's easy to cry a lot and get mad at everything and everyone <sub>🌧</sub><br>
but the important thing is to take a deep breath and think before you act not to hurt yourself or other people !<br>
things will not be always easy or positive, right ?<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅰ<br>
i want to urgently vent on this, it's so tiring to see people being bitter and negative, i just wanted to say : the world is not ugly.<br>
the world is not a bad place, people are not horrible, life is not sad and tragic, no no no !!!<br>
to begin with, the world is simply neutral. nature works in an extremely balanced way, everything is always in its proper place + bad and good things are equally necessary for everything to work well. it's impossible for a world to be good if only good things exist, i know it's confusing, but good and evil only exist if both exist. and this is something positive !<br>
good experiences are better after bad moments of perseverance to achieve them. dreams are only dreams because they can't be realized right away. the fact that there are bad things and difficulties should be something that motivates you and makes the world interesting and beautiful, not the other way around ; ;<br>
moreover, beauty is something very abstract in general. the world is not really ugly or beautiful, it's neutral because beauty depends on the eyes of the beholder. for example, you may very much like to eat a dish that looks disgusting but has a divine flavor. the "beauty" as we know is something visual, not that it's wrong, since i myself am an extremely visual person and always use this love for beauty to find out more about myself and the world, beautiful things make me feel happy and motivated, i love beauty ; but this is not so important in the world in general.<br>
our sight is something sensitive and if you miss it, it's not as if all the beauty is gone. even if beauty is mostly visual, there is a lot more involved in this concept than we should consider as well. good things are always present in our lives : smells, tastes, sounds, textures... all this is as important as the visual. the beauty is in all this, so it is impossible not to have beauty in all things, no matter how "ugly" it may seem.<br>
the world, life, nature, being perfectly neutral, allow us to take our paths and interpret things as we wish. i consider it healthy enough to be positive and see the usefulness and necessity of bad things as a motivational and educational way, and see good things as blessings to be enjoyed to the fullest, cherished and treasured as nostalgias. i consider the world a perfectly beautiful place because i want to be happy. like, why would i see the bad side of everything on purpose ? this doesn't make sense to me.<br>
my desire is to mature enough to be happy and find beauty and importance in all sorts of things. it's not just a romanticization, it's a way of being able to enjoy life in a healthy and light way, to stay bright and pure no matter what bad experiences you have experienced.<br>
the world is neutral but i consider it the most beautiful thing possible because it is purely perfect exactly as it is. ♡<br>
<br>
to complete this subject, i think people are also very negative when they talk about their bodies... and i'm not even talking about visual insecurities about it, but people really underestimate their bodies. our physical body is not just a bunch of flesh and by chance we're stuck inside it, it makes me sad when people talk like that, it's so disrespectful ; ;<br>
our physical body is much more than just where we live, it's an organism. our organism. and even being ours, we control almost nothing about it, have you ever thought of it ? our body digests food all by itself, our body absorbs the vitamins from sunlight all by itself, our body keeps the temperature stable by all by itself, our body heals bruises all by itself !!! this is so wonderful, our body does everything possible to keep us healthy, not just physically, but emotionally as well. our body even offers endorphins to make us feel rewarded when we have good attitudes and everything ( and these genuinely make us happy ). even if you have a terminal illness, your body will never give up trying to heal you, it will try to keep you as healthy as possible until the last second ! i know it's all instinctive and natural, not really an act of voluntary goodness ; but it's still positive, isn't it ♡ ?<br>
i honestly feel my heart ache when i see people treating their bodies badly... our bodies are so good to us. yes, it fails sometimes, i myself have several skin allergies and for a long time blamed my body for it. my skin is too sensitive and has exaggerated and bad reactions to deal with things it doesn't approve of, but my skin is not conscious. it doesn't know that it's exaggerating, but it still does a great job and keeps me generally very healthy, so it would be unfair not to like it just because it's too sensitive ///<br>
besides our body always doing its best to keep us safe, healthy and satisfied, it is an important part of nature. our body is much larger than we think, there are infinite other tiny living beings that live in our body! our body is not only good for us as it is for other living beings, and it protects all this "small" ecosystem of living things that is harmful and damages our balance.<br>
it is very important that we take care of our physical body in the best possible way : eat properly, use your muscles, get enough sleep, drink water.. whatever you can do, because it is not only a container for your soul, but a part of nature. being organic can have disadvantages, but being part of nature and being such a complex organism is definitely very rewarding and an experience that we should value ♡ !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
i've seen a lot of "self care" content lately, which is pretty good, but some of them are a very confusing or materialistic. i support all sorts of naturally healthy and satisfying tips for our relaxation and well-being ; but some tips are simply toxic, for they force us to do things and be in situations that might do us more harm than good ; ;<br>
i've been feeling kinda sad over the last few days because i've discovered some bad things about people i had not noticed before.. i'm very happy, i'm satisfied with my life, i enjoy every day to the fullest and i try to observe the details and enjoy my time. i have routines and rules to follow that i consider healthy and i feel happy to follow because they bring me good things. i always try to be authentic and sincere, i don't like to pretend or seek approval from other people, i don't do anything that doesn't bring me joy and satisfaction. i give my best to help others in everything i can, and above all, to be happy. and i am happy. i have several life goals, but i'm happy at the moment too, because i live completely and honestly. i believe that i take good care of myself, since i feel happy, right ?<br>
but i realized that people who are following standards for their lives, who are not honest with themselves, who seek happiness just in the future, in objects, in appearance, in relationships... people who are not happy, they can't accept that some people can be happy. truly happy. i realized that some people think i'm "weird" and antisocial, maybe even depressive, because i don't have a very active social life, because i don't maintain relationships with people who are toxic, because i don't force myself to do things that make me sad. i felt sad about it because i realized that it is impossible to "prove" to people that i really am happy and that i could even try to help them to be happier, too. they just don't believe me. they just keep "caring" about me and trying to help me ( ????? )<br>
so after reading about these attitudes i was able to learn something crucial about self care : do nothing that is not comfortable for you.<br>
i know that sometimes we need to make efforts to achieve our goals, but don't push yourself beyond the limit. if something you do is sincerely making you sad and making your life bad, don't do it.<br>
it's hard because people are going to think bad things about you, especially if for being happy you need to isolate yourself a bit socially. i'm a very introverted person so for me it is sincerely very uncomfortable being in some situations, and i don't put myself into them, i refuse. i'm honest and i just hope people will respect me, but people don't respect that kind of choice because they think we have to constantly fight against ourselves to fit patterns and thus be happy.<br>
a good example : your dream of full happiness is to live on a farm completely isolated from society. you accomplish this dream and you are more fully happy than you have ever been before !! people should be happy for you, right ? in fact, they will always tend to feel sorry for you and think that you are isolating yourself, depressingly. this is because they can't imagine themselves in the same situation as you as something good, it's not like they're being purposely inconvenient, they just don't understand. and that's why some self care tips are not always good or work for everyone ; everyone's happiness is found in different ways. we must respect this !<br>
you will never be happy if you force yourself to do things that make you sad, if you keep on seeking incessantly for happiness, molding yourself to be the "rich", "healthy", "successful", "beautiful", "friendly" people think you need to be ; this is not how life works. there's no way you can fit into all these molds, it's an unobtainable ideal. being happy and taking good care of yourself is much simpler than it seems, it just involves being yourself and doing what you love ♡<br>
fill your life with things that make you smile, that make you feel healthy and full. fill your life and your mind with your purity, your essence, you can be happy just being full. that is perfection. there is no better self care than being happy now and with what you have : you will be a much better, secure, kinder, wiser person ; you will be better for yourself and for others !!!<br>
i know it may seem a bit vague, but it's just that : don't take self care tips "for your own good", even if it comes from people you love, if those tips don't make you happy. it's just not good or right.<br>
<br><br>
that's it for today !! take care <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍰</sub><br>
yes, so many posts in a short time !!<br>
this is because i have a lot of content to post here, and more and more... so i have planned several posts yet for this year !<br>
i have learned a lot about plants, it has become a great interest <sub>🌱</sub><br>
i've always been very interested in animals, but i think plants are also great, i just.. really like to take care of other living things, in general.<br>
i feel really good helping who i can, i want to take care of many plants and animals, the best as i can <sub>🍄</sub><br>
<br>
i have organized many things here these days, old things.<br>
this has left me pretty nostalgic, so i decided to start some projects to "eternalize" my memories !<br>
i have several letter paper and notebook pages that i kind of collected when i was in school, so i decided to cover a box with my favorite papers and use it to keep my journals. i've had diaries since i was 8, so they're very precious to me ♡<br>
the box got a 2000s aesthetic with many different shades of pink and glitter.. which is nostalgically perfect, even if not very aesthetically neat, you know ?<br>
thinking about it, i remembered the digital stuff that i did at the time, that follow this same idea ! <sub>🍓</sub><br>
i have here folders with very old things, from when i started to use the internet, including several .txt files with posts that i posted on my old blog, all the images i used ( i always kept everything for security )<br>
and, i also have all the layouts i've done + the codes !!<br>
i would really like to eternalize my first blog..<br>
so i recreated my first blog, from 2004, with the codes and images and texts i had saved, with a post from 2006, and it's all exactly as it was before <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
i used a cute domain ( 2006.pooftie.me ), because it really fits the whole thing ~<br>
i had to re-create some scripts that were for the old internet explorer, so it didn't work anymore.<br>
i used to embed youtube videos on the blog for music, so that's what i did. i didn't have the exact music i was using at the time, but i remember it was from di gi charat, so that's what i put there !<br>
i liked to use english words sometimes, but i didn't really know any english at the time. should be the reason why i put my personal info in the "things" column instead of the "me" one LOL<br>
if you know portuguese, you should be surprised with my correct grammar ( since i was 8 ), and it's true, i had the help of my mom to write everything right on my blog !<br>
of course my mom always knew what i posted on my blog, so she helped me a lot. it was a very important time for me, i was learning many new things and i read and write a lot <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
i think the internet can be very productive for children, if they use it in a healthy way.<br>
i have many good memories of my old blog, i'm very happy that now it really is properly eternalized !<br>
<br>
today i'm going to post another needle felt cutie here, a shy little lamb <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

　<sub>📍</sub> ⅰ<br>
people who have an interest in web design often have doubts about how i made this site and all my html stuff. as you all know, i've made things in html for many years, and i make lots of original and random things all the time. html and css is really something i love ♡ !<br>
i made this site, just like all my stuff in html, from scratch. i write everything in notepad and test in .html files, or in <a text-decoration: none; href="https://test.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">my html tester</font></a>. i know there are several platforms nowadays that make things a lot easier, but i always did everything from scratch because it was how i decided to start with html, from the beginning i always thought : if i had total freedom with the codes and to put everything exactly where i want and as i wish ; it was perfect. it was what i wanted. dealing with platforms for web design has always irritated me a little, honestly ; ;<br>
so, i don't have platforms to recommend, besides tumblr, because i use it and never had problems. but still, dealing with pure html is my preferred way of doing things. if you are going to make a website that is a blog or something, which will always need to be updated, using a platform would be really simpler to begin with ; but i recommend training html the old way because it helps a lot in learning ! if you really want to do things beautifully and freely, you have to lose the fear of dealing with pure codes.<br>
web design obviously has a lot of aesthetic sense, but i've talked about aesthetics many times around here so i think this part is unnecessary... but still about visual, i really recommend you have folders of materials and graphics that can be useful. i have had several folders of materials since i was a kid, and i got all that content basically exploring the internet. blogs and websites of cute stuff are a bit rare nowadays, but on tumblr i always find it with a little effort !! the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://web.archive.org" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">wayback machine</font></a> is also wonderful to find interesting sites. i have here on the site the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://middlepot.com/recommended" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">recommended page</font></a> where i have some sites & blog that can be useful for this.<br>
now that you have several materials to do beautiful things, you need to deal with the code itself. i find html very easy, i learned to deal with it at 8, simply with small tutorials and mainly browsing other people's blogs. i know it may seem controversial but when it comes to html there is a lot that you can ( and should ) take reference to other people's codes because these are things that everyone can use and are not owned by someone specific. i honestly recommend that you always look at the source code of all the sites you are interested in understanding how they were made. after a little study you will understand how things work and will learn mostly from this practice. make sure you have a folder for codes ( you can just save it in txt files ) because you will always find things that are interesting and that you may want to use in the future ! when it comes to css and javascript ( style and script ) you can find some code that is original and can not be copied, but in this case you will certainly see a warning text. if you see no warning, you are free to try to use !<br>
to practice, i recommend doing small projects like some pictures and texts on the screen, cute little random things that you have in mind... just let the imagination flow, think of things you'd like to do with the codes you've saved. if you really want to do layouts for a website or blog, i recommend starting with a base code. it's very bad copying the whole source code from someone's site to use as a base, but many people provide very useful base codes for you to have room for all things, it makes things very easy ! you just have to decide what you want to do exactly and look for codes for that sort of thing. you can find whole codes that are visually neutral for you to modify, or you can find only parts of what you want. you can put it all together smoothly. if you are using specific platforms, you will need base code to do what you want functionally within the platform, since these have rules of use and operation.<br>
it's a lot of fun to add signatures and some codes that you specifically like in your base codes. seeing ideas being born is sure to be the biggest motivation for you, so please don't give up before you try !!!<br>
i have a base code myself, i always use some similar css and i have a pretty cute ascii art signature at the beginning and end of all html pages. in fact, to be clear, <b>i allow</b> you to always look at the source code of this site and my stuff if you need inspiration or understand how i did things in it. you can use all the scripts and css, too. just don't copy everything ( especially visually ), of course, be original !<br>
in the beginning, you may feel a little bit of tension in messing with the base code and ruining everything, but over time you will feel more comfortable. i took a lot of time to do things freely, remembering that i did my first layout at the age of 8, so although i managed to do pretty good things, i obviously had a long time to get to where i am today ///<br>
it's normal that you don't understand anything that's going on for a long time, but don't worry about it, because the important thing is that things are working. you will understand how everything works with practice. now, when it comes to javascript, the thing really complicates. is much more "programming" than html and css, so you'll have to study harder if you want to make interesting scripts by yourself ; but you don't have to worry about it if programming is not your interest because you can find the scripts you need to do all sorts of things if you search right. it is still possible to make great things only with your interest in the visual side of web design ♡ !<br>
good, now that you already have your inspirations, your materials & graphics folder, your useful codes folder, your base codes.. where to post your projects and studies ?<br>
there are several sites where you can post things in html, but i use and recommend github. in it you can make a repository for every project you have and put the .html files there, you can change the domain and everything. about domains, github has its own domain for pages, but there are other sites where you can get cute and exclusive domains for you ! the site i use to get all my html stuff domains is <a text-decoration: none; href="https://freedns.afraid.org" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">freedns</font></a> ( just be careful to choose only public domains ). by the way, you can also use those cute domains on tumblr.<br>
to get ssl on your html pages, remember that all the links you have in your code must be "https", including images and scripts. thus, you will be able to get ssl easily on any platform you are using ! finding good websites ( with ssl ) to host your stuff to use in your codes can be difficult and time-consuming, but i have on the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://middlepot.com/credits" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">credits page</font></a> all the sites i use to host each file type ! i recommend each of them, until the present moment.<br>
<br>
i think that's all !! everything that i indicated here are things that i legitimately do and that work for me.<br>
i hope from the bottom of my heart that i can help and inspire you ♡ !!!<br>
please feel free to ask me something else that i may have forgotten to explain here ( which is not too specific, because this text is more general as a guide for beginners )<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
so, to begin with, i would like to say that beauty is directly linked to good things about people. a kind person is certainly very beautiful, and i've talked about it before... but in a more visual way, i believe that the healthier and natural you look, the more beautiful, visually. if you keep artificial and unhealthy, it will be hard to feel comfortable in your body, and that is an important attribute for beauty. people who are just running away from their natural beauty have hard times with self-esteem, and that's sad.<br>
i would like to help, so i'll give you beauty tips on what i value : health and comfort !<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> skin care :<br>
i have very sensitive skin, i have allergies frequently. this condition always makes me worry about the products i use. i always use natural products or baby products, these don't give me allergy and luckily are also great, i don't think i should be using any other type of product !<br>
i think it is essential to keep the skin clean, hydrated and free of harsh chemicals. i always wash the skin with natural ( or baby ) soaps, which are very soft and don't take too much natural oil from the skin. my skin is not very oily so i worry about keeping the natural oils and using them to my advantage. i've never had problems with acne or blackheads, but i've always had whiteheads, what have helped me more than anything about them and also keeps my skin completely clean of any pollution are two things : honey and rose milk !<br>
honey is truly amazing, the skin becomes incredibly soft, clean, with an incredible natural glow and it also helps a lot in recovering from any damage, since it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. i use honey on my skin frequently, i also use it + sugar to exfoliate from time to time. i always use in bruises and when my skin is having allergic reactions to avoid bigger problems and help in healthy recovery.<br>
rose milk is basically rose water + baking soda and some other things, which make the rose water become milky in texture and color. this mixture cleans a lot from any pollution, it's amazing and i use it whenever i feel i need.<br>
to moisturize i always use natural oils or baby oil. i always apply by massaging on the whole body, especially in areas with more fat, because this helps blood circulation and the skin gets more elasticity ( massaging the face is also very important ). my favorite oils are coconut oil and almond oil ! i think the combination of the two smells like honey, but everyone says it smells like vanilla. i love vanilla and honey, so i'm happy anyway ♡<br>
despite my skin care routine ( with cleansing, exfoliation & hydration ) is only once a day, it's important to keep the skin clean and moisturized all day. during the winter my skin gets very dry, so i'm always moisturizing it, multiple times a day. during the summer my skin easily looks greasy, especially if i'm outside, so i always clean my face and hands with baby wipes ( washing only with fresh water is most appropriate but not always possible ) and use moisturizer. keeping the skin fresh is very important to avoid pollution and premature aging !<br>
i can also recommend you to always wash your face with cold water ( your pores NEVER should be left open ), wear sunscreen every day, i recommend the most natural ones with coconut oil ( the sun is important and it is good to sunbathe in the morning, but the afternoon sun can be terribly bad for your skin + NEVER pose your face towards the sun ) and of course : drink lots of water ( two liters a day is the minimum ), this is really important !!<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> hair care :<br>
because of the sensitivity of my skin, i also use natural products or baby products in my hair, of course. since my hair is completely natural i don't need to worry so much about it, i use few products. my hair is very wavy and long. it is also not too oily just like my skin, so i also like to take advantage of the natural oils. i usually wash it three times a week in hot weather and twice in cold weather, i only use water and baby shampoo normally. no conditioner. why did i mention the water ? because it is very important, even if you have not thought about it, it's part of the cleaning process as well. i always wash my hair with plenty of water and rub well the root to spread the natural oils to the tips, only after i use a little shampoo to clean the excess oil, sweat and pollution. i feel that this process makes my hair much lighter and it gets very clean, soft and hydrated ! for extra hydration i always use natural oils, the same ones i use for the skin. washing with cold water is very important to prevent oiliness in the hair, i also always use cold dryer. always dry the root very well !<br>
another thing that i think is very important is combing your hair with a wide wooden comb ( or a similar brush ). these combs keeps the hair very soft and hydrated up to the tips, plus they don't cause hair loss or frizz. to keep your hair always looking soft and moisturized from the root to the tips it's very important to brush your hair multiple times a day, especially if you are out there because the pollution gives it a greasy look that is not healthy.<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> makeup :<br>
um i almost don't wear makeup, so i surely don't have much experience to talk about it. i don't like to wear makeup because i feel my skin very weird.. i only use it on special occasions, even though it is always very light. i think wearing just a little makeup helps my skin stay healthy, anyway. it doesn't like many products.<br>
i don't like wearing base or concealer, i just have bb cream in case there is something wrong that i want to cover.. usually there is nothing besides dark circles, and i'm used to it, so i just let it be.<br>
in my eyes my biggest problem is my eyelashes, you must have realized that they are very straight. i don't like that, so it's common for me to use eyelash curler and brown mascara with a very thin brush, just to keep them in place. i have brown eye pencils for sometimes delineating, i like to keep it as natural as possible.<br>
i don't do anything with my eyebrows, i don't really bother with them all natural.<br>
i don't like bronzer, but i really like blush, i like it a lot, especially cream brush ! i also like highlighter, but i use it wisely ( i try ). i always get inspired in igari makeup and i struggle not to use too much blush and look like sunburned ; ;<br>
on my lips i always moisturize constantly with natural oils ( my lips get dry often i hate it ), but i am truly an eternal lover of lip gloss and lip balm. i don't like lipsticks, though. i like to have my lips super moisturized and shiny, but not very colored.<br>
umm and sometimes i add a little tiny bit of white glitter on my cheeks, lips or eyelids ! i think it's very cute.<br>
for sealing the makeup, if i’m outside for long periods of time, i like using a tiny bit of moisturizing translucent powder. it looks natural, and also feels more comfortable on my skin.<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> nails :<br>
i'm also not experienced with nail art, but i'll talk about my nails anyway. i think there are not many secrets to getting your nails healthy, i think proper nutrition and hydration are the most important thing. my nails grow very fast, just like my hair, i can't really tell the reasons because it was always like this.. but i can say i always keep them super moisturized with natural oils ( the same ones i use for the skin ), i moisturize them multiple times a day, whenever i wash my hands. it's very important to always keep your nails clean and moisturized, so i never forget the baby wipes and the moisturizer when i'm outside !<br>
i always cut the cuticles ( not too much, just the excess ) and keep them clean. i used to paint my nails often and did nail art on them, but i stopped doing it because i just don't feel interested anymore. people always say that keeping nails painted is important to keep them strong but i can confirm that this is a myth, at least partially. when i always painted my nails and one day i didn't they were really weak, it's true ; but this is because they were already damaged by the use of nail polish. when i stopped using nail polish frequently, after a few months they became stronger, beautiful and healthier than ever before ! in this case, it depends on whether you want to use polish frequently or not.<br>
i usually keep my nails very short and oval shape, but when i'm in the mood i let them a little longer and almond shape.<br>
what is most important for me to keep healthy nails is to always cut my cuticles ( so i don't pick on my skin when i'm anxious ) , as well as to file and hydrate frequently, so they stay shiny & cute at all times !<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> tl ; dr :<br>
if you always stay clean, moisturized and hydrated you will always be healthy and flawless from the beginning until the end of the day, which will definitely make your life a lot better !!<br>
<br><br>
i'm very sincere in these texts, really based on personal experiences.<br>
i always try my best to be clear and useful to you,<br>
so please tell me your opinions <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hiiiiii fluffies <sub>🦋</sub><br>
i'm having lots of ideas for projects, but it's hard to organize time for all things ..<br>
i'm planning new things for the store, i'm sooooo happy with the progress !!!<br>
things are definitely exceeding my expectations <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i'll not tell you my plans for now, since i still have to try hard to make it happen the way i want it <sub>🌕</sub><br>
i just have to thank you a lot for the messages and the affection i receive, it makes me always motivated to do my best <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
<br>
this post will be a little long, so i'll start right away with the things i did last week !<br>
i'll start with this beautiful collage, which i was planning to do for some time :<br>

yes.. if you know <a text-decoration: none; href="https://www.instagram.com/mjolktander" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">𝔪𝔞𝔧𝔞</font></a>, you know that most of these photos are hers <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
it's truly an ethereal aesthetic, don't you think ?<br>
i believe that no one is better than her to represent it <sub>🤍</sub><br>
it was a great experience for me to deal with so different color tones together !<br>
i feel like i usually run away from dark colors on almost anything, but they also represent a part of who i am, it's important that i practice more how to use them within my aesthetic !<br>
<br>
here's the melody i used, i think it matched perfectly :<br>

with kinda the same aesthetic, i made a page in html that is very simple, but it is somehow very important for me.<br>
of course, with matching url ( soft.pooftie.me )<br>
i've always wanted to do something like this in html, but it's strangely time-consuming, even though it looks so simple <sub>🪑</sub><br>
it's pretty nonsense, but i really put some feelings into it, so i hope you like it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

the first one is about cuteness & femininity, the second one is about group behavior !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅰ<br>
people have always had a problem with female stereotypes. there is pressure on the girls to be always cute, feminine and delicate. i totally disapprove of people trying to shape the personality of people for the purpose of making them "ideal" within stereotypes ; although girls and boys have hormones that bring tendencies in tastes, desires and looks, a person's sєx has no relation to her personality, since that is something much deeper. i agree that girls and boys should not change their personality with the intention of feeling "fit" in society, since this behavior causes sadness, confusion, problems and unhealthy relationships.<br>
but, in the search of freedom of aesthetics and mannerisms people began to always treat these feminine adjectives as if they were something inferior and undesirable. i have read countless times about how "being cute and delicate is desirable in society because they want women to be weak and controllable", and no, that's not a correct way to talk about it !!!<br>
the cuteness, delicacy and elegance are feminine characteristics, and just like the masculine characteristics, are tendencies but not facts. a girl may have more masculine characteristics, and vice versa ; there is nothing wrong with that. in nature the feminine and the masculine work together and form all that exists of good ( and bad ), it's the balance of things. the personality of people is complex and there are no sєx tendencies that change a person completely, so of course you should not change who you are because of that ; but wanting to reject your natural feminine qualities because you somehow think that male qualities are better, is a very serious problem. it is actually offensive to the female image.<br>
makes me deeply sad as people speak as if being soft and delicate is a sign of weakness and inferiority when there is no connexion between these things. to say that being feminine is a bad thing and that we must fight not to appear feminine and delicate for not to be treated in a bad way is so extremely wrong !!<br>
girls and boys in nature have strength, endurance and power equally, only represented in different ways. matriarchal and patriarchal societies are focused on these forces : motherhood & paternity. these are the most natural and pure in both, both take care of each other as family, both have different but equally important roles. the problem is that patriarchal society often makes it seem that the male strenght is desirable and important, that physical strength, dominance, and logical reasoning are the best, that emotional intelligence, kindness, and wisdom are weak. this is not true, because there is not one better than the other ( and i've written about this before ).<br>
in fact, the female image is also very associated with beauty. this obviously doesn't mean that girls should be beautiful, but i would like to comment that this type of beauty is associated with health and youth, since it is something that is naturally bright and wonderful related to fertility. in this way, while healthy, pure and natural, feminine beauty is something that i appreciate a lot and that i also think should not be treated as objectification ; the real objectification is the plastic and artificial way the girls force themselves to be to have social approval.<br>
so yes, if your personality have cuteness and femininity, it doesn't mean that you are inferior or childish. you should not be ashamed of it or try to become more masculine ( even if you are indeed a boy ). you must above all embrace your natural qualities and your personality traits as your strength and importance in society exist anyway and are great. you can have an even submissive personality, and that doesn't mean you don't have the right to be happy like that and have control over your life and your actions !<br>
just remember that you deserve to be happy and respected, you are strong and lovely no matter how feminine or masculine you are, you can - and should - be purely yourself ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
this recent subject about "npc" people is something that has been around for a long time, but with other names. i really think being a npc is a bad thing, but i'm seeing people using it as a baseless curse, i see people with clear group behavior using the term to get approved and feel superior to others. i believe that this whole thing can be very productive if seen and treated the right way, so i felt the need to write about it !<br>
group behavior is basically what the idea of ​​being an npc is all about. it's about acting only in favor of the group, seeking approval from the group and always feel the need to be part of groups and overestimate this attitude as if it were something important. this is a purely instinctive and standard attitude of our species, so i believe it is natural and healthy to have group behavior during a phase of life, usually in adolescence, while we are still trying to perceive our individuality ( which has always been there, we have only forgotten who we are because pubєrty causes our hormones to take actions above who we really are, basically for the sake of the reproduction of the species ).<br>
the problem of such attitudes is that they separate us from purity and consequently from happiness. as we are rational animals, group behavior, although natural and to make our brain release endorphins ( as instinctive approval ), makes us take actions that do not make us really happy. the pursuit of standards, mimic behavior, obeying rules that we don't really value, following trends that don't match our personality... all of this is extremely tiring and painful for us. the npc behavior is in fact something bad and that must be overcome, because although institive, is not ideal. you are not doing your best if you are acting as a group because you are an individual.<br>
i see many people with npc behavior using this as offense because they relate specific things to "being an npc", such as using social media, having groups of friends, using slangs... but the thing is that group behavior is not something that it is necessarily shown through these attitudes, for a person can of their own volition want to have some of these attitudes, because it makes they happy. making the decision to have some natural, instinctive behavior as something that you truly value is an important and rational decision that is right for our ability. for example, i want to form a family, it's a group behavior and extremely instinctive : to live with my partner, to procreate, to take care of my group. but if i had made that decision only because it's the standard of our society, it could be sad for me and against my will as an individual ! i want to have a family because only the thought of it warms my heart and i know it is my pure wish.<br>
the desire for stamina for group behavior can be replaced by other more useful and healthy attitudes such as helping others, striving for a cause that you truly value, giving gifts, giving compliments... the list goes on !<br>
we don't have to obey our instincts, but they can guide us to important things if we are strong enough to make our own choices. ♡<br>
<br>
i hope this helps some people !!<br>

my lovely store is open and with an extremely cute layout !!!!<br>
modesty aside, i'm really in love with the layout i made <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
i'm so very happy to have decided to make a layout of my own. before i was not going to do it and i was going to use a platform, i thought it would make things easier ...<br>
but i definitely think it's important that my store is as cute as possible and i'd like to do my best for that !!!<br>
i used a subdomain for the store : https://shybunny.middlepot.com<br>

so, i made yesterday a very cute new flash game <sub>💻</sub><br>

very playfull and cute, just like kittens !<br>
<br>
so, today i want the post to be light, so i'll write about a slightly more personal subject, with some tips <sub>🧇</sub><br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i once wrote about myself and my personality and i mentioned how i like to organize and improve myself, and how i like rules. as i always support the purity, happiness & comfort of people, why would i support rules being imposed to shape us ?<br>
i know it can be confusing, but i actually think the rules, if handled correctly, can help us a lot to find out more about ourselves, and not shape ourselves to be something different, but the other way around.<br>
social and behavioral rules can be very oppressive and force us to act in an uncomfortable way, to make us confused under the obligation to be accepted socially above being ourselves, and happy ; but by analyzing these kinds of rules and constantly questioning them, i could see that they actually made me realize who i really am ! by reading these rules and wondering if they really fit into my lifestyle and personality, i could see clearly what i wanted or not for my life. i could understand the principles and foundations of these rules, and where they "wanted us to go". usually social and behavioral rules have the general objective that you be a nice person and don't bother other people, and that is a good thing ; the problem is that these have very specific peculiarities that don't fit for anyone. all people feel uncomfortable and unhappy if they try to follow all these rules strictly because they don't fit everyone. in short, my solution to achieving a healthy life was to adapt these rules to my way !<br>
i really like writing rules for myself and even having rules made for me, reading about all those rules and "good manners" that are supposed to make a "good person". i find it very productive and it helps me a lot to find myself individually rewriting these rules so that they still have their main good intention but in a way that is comfortable for me as a person. i can see how personally i could feel happy to follow some good, healthy rules as a way of reminders. i value a lot of rules that involve kindness, education and respect, as i believe that it is fundamental to have healthy relationships and it makes me happy ; it just happens that these rules are very "heavy" and try to change ourselves, but there are usually ways of interpreting and rewriting them that make them good and productive for our lives.<br>
it is clear that some rules simply don't fit my life at all, and should be discarded. unfortunately, even striving to keep polite and sincere with people who question me about such "weird" attitudes that i choose for my life ( for example refusing to be in social events supposed to be important to my social life, but that doesn't make me happy ) people will still judge me negatively because i didn't obey "the rule". this is something we naturally suffer as a consequence of being truly honest and kind to ourselves, but it is also an important process in the pursuit of purity.<br>
i really care about evaluating my behavior, in general. when we are busy with our tasks we may forget to take care of ourselves, so i believe it is very important to always stop from time to time and think "how am i feeling ?", "is my body feeling well ?". stop for drinking water, wash your face, eat a fruit, walking, adjusting the lighting... these simple things are primordial to maintain our physical and mental health. like this habit, when i'm interacting with other people i always evaluate my behavior to see if i'm expressing myself properly, if i'm being kind, sincere, if i'm being myself, if the conversation is being comfortable for me and the other person. this may seem maybe a little "obsessive", but if done in a healthy and natural way is very good and greatly improves our quality of life. all these "rules" are about doing my best and not letting myself get carried away by the things of life and forgetting about my health or being nice to people.<br>
it's primordial not to expect other people's approval and social validation when defining your rules and lifestyle, but rather how you personally, from the heart, feel about it. of course, you will feel happy and satisfied in being a good person and not messing around, but it is completely different from pretending just to receive compliments, to feel included and correct. the most correct and valid you can be is yourself ♡<br>
<br>
i know it's a little difficult to understand, but i hope i have explained it clearly !!<br>
happy halloween for you, be careful not to eat toooooo much candy <sub>🎃</sub><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🐇</sub><br>
aaa i'm so excited !!!<br>
i'm finally ready to start my online store, shy bunny <sub>💕</sub><br>
i took pictures of all the items and i will post them in the next days !<br>
i'm going to do disclosure on my accounts, which has similar aesthetics, and i also plan to make a giveaway.<br>
i'm organizing everything the best i can <sub>👜</sub><br>
<br>
well, i plan to post lots of cute crafts from now on !!<br>
i'm very happy about this, since it is something as important to me as my digital works.<br>
lately i've been pretty excited about trying different aesthetics for decoration, i'm always saving new material and i get inspired easily !<br>
i always have real strong tendencies for decorating everything with my main aesthetic ( because it always warms my heart right away ), but i believe my secondary aesthetics also represent important parts of who i am. <sub>🎗</sub><br>
i think they deserve some love too <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i'm having lots of fun trying new color combinations, different textures... i feel that i'm improving a lot.<br>
today i'm going to show you a very nice chubby teddy bear, that will be in the store :<br>

<br>
in this post i have an important thing to talk with you, besides the main q&a subject.<br>
i want to talk about why i gave up using the feedback buttons on my website, as well as the hit counter !<br>
( yes, a lot of text lately, i hope it's not a problem ; ; )<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅰ<br>
since i wrote my "honest post" to you i reflected a lot about my attitudes. whenever i write something i do it initially to improve myself. i changed the way i treat my photos, i felt the need to clarify a lot of confusing things for you about personality and behavior that might be useful.. but i still felt very upset about the numbers on that site.<br>
i decided a few days ago that i want to stop using the feedback buttons as well as the hit counter. i've never really liked the idea of ​​exposed numbers because people always take them too seriously, above the quality of content... they really think that numbers represent something important when in fact it's not realistic or impartial ; ;<br>
i started using them because i liked to have feedback, but i think it turned out to be something not very relevant at some point... i'm not devaluing your clicks, but i prefer feedbacks with constructive words, tips and opinions, not just one approval or disapproval number. this has not really helped me improve, it's nothing compared to the messages i get. people are not numbers, they are individuals with real and important opinions and feelings. i want real opinions.<br>
to be honest, i was very happy to see the numbers growing, but i know that they don't represent much of anything other than the site is growing in visits ( which is good, but overvalued ). the numbers are mostly positive, and i feel extremely happy about it, but it's definitely exaggerated. reading true and honest messages from the visitors proved infinitely more enriching for me, even the shorter messages were written by someone who really wanted to give their opinion.<br>
social media have created this need for big numbers in people and even after partially abandoning social media altogether i have tried to use the feedback button system in my favor here, and it was quite useful at first, but i feel that i don't have more reasons to keep it here than to praise a false reputation for my image on the internet. i'm just a normal person doing my best, just like any other producer on any other website. i reflected a lot on this and people treating me differently because of numbers is not something that i value and i don't think is good for me or the visitors. the race for numbers and fame is not the kind of thing i'd be proud to encourage on my site ( or anywhere else, but unfortunately that's not always an option ).<br>
i kept the numbers exposed despite not approving their overvaluation because i believed it could bring public ; maybe people could took me more seriously if i had big numbers ? maybe they could allow themselves to look at the site more easily if they saw this "seal of approval" from previous visitors ?<br>
... but is it really worth blinding people with such superficial information and then saying it's not important ?<br>
i have come to the conclusion that i must be an example and show that appreciation of numbers is not healthy or productive.<br>
i felt free from this race for numbers as i moved away from social media, and i discovered over time that frequent visitors of my site are not here either by the numbers, but by the content, just as they are on other interesting sites and blogs of the internet. it definitely warms my heart to know that neatly my work honestly attracts so many people ♡<br>
so, i removed the feedback buttons from all the pages of the site and also removed the hit counter from the index, although i still know how many ips visits my site, this is more for technical information. consider these changes as a purification, it's extremely invigorating to be free of ego needs and social fears ~<br>
i hope hiding the numbers and keeping the written feedback is more productive for me and for you ! i wish from the bottom of my heart that you participate more avidly in this site, and not in the form of numbers, but as wonderful and real angels, which is what you are to me. ♡<br>
( remembering that i love exchanging long emails and letters, so be sure to get in touch with me at letters@middlepot.com if you want to talk to me )<br>

　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
this subject is not so questioned but some people are curious to know what religion i have, since i occasionally write things that seem kinda religious..<br>
basically, i'm a paganist ! i do not consider myself anything more than that. i am a daughter of mother nature ; nature is my god and goddess, it's everything to me. nature guides me in all difficult times and has always helped me to make the right decisions, nature makes me feel at home wherever i am, it is because of her that i'm learning to see beauty in all things and to value the things that really matter and that make me happy. following my role in nature is my dream and guiding others to happiness & comfort is my passion ♡ !<br>
i often thank nature for everything i am blessed to enjoy in the most unexpected moments. i make prayers to bring good energies to the ones i love. i feel a lot of motherhood in nature and so i usually refer to it in a feminine way, but nature also has paternity depending on the moment so referring in a masculine way can happen. i have always been very attached to nature and mythology has always been a very great interest, i have always believed from the bottom of my heart in magic and in the magical beings who secretly play their role in nature & i utterly love to make offerings for these beings who take care of me and of whom i love. i also greatly appreciate sympathies and rituals that bring good energies and help us connect with nature. i usually do these things from my heart, instinctively, so i'm not part of communities or specific religion within paganism, although reading about these things is something i absolutely love doing.<br>
i always feel a very strong bond with fairies, angels and rabbits. i believe there are some particularities of my being that are the same as theirs, so i identify a lot even though i am a human. the role of the fairies in nature, the protective wings of the angels, the purity and maternity of the rabbits... these are virtues that i long for ♡ !<br>
i believe in faith as much as in fate. in my view, both are forces that work in our lives. when fate is absolute and yet your faith goes beyond limits, that's how miracles happen. i believe that the destiny is something that has no relation to us and where is our luck, as long as faith is composed of energies that make up our essence ; so we can also mess up our luck with negative thoughts, it's important to be careful with our feelings.<br>
i unhesitatingly believe in afterlifes, i don't have a clear vision of what it is, but i believe it is certainly something very fruitful for our soul, full of new opportunities ! i also believe in other types of lives simultaneously happening, in secret from us ( other realities and other worlds, like our dream world ).<br>
lastly, i would like to comment that i believe that all religions and personal beliefs of each person are important and that if the person is being guided to be better each day, they are certainly following the right path. i accept with all my heart any prayer and good blessings that anyone sends me. i love feeling connected in peace with other people so i love all kinds of expressions of affection, religious or not ♡<br>
<br>
i wish you all the joy and solace !!!<br>
<br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>💖</sub><br>
aaa i have good news, and some updates !!<br>
i got a new camera, i'm so excited, i already took some beautiful pictures <sub>📷</sub><br>
i used to take pictures with my old phone or my mom's camera, which is good, but it was not always possible, so it kept me from taking pictures of some specific things like some of my crafts and.. well, myself.<br>
because of that, my pictures were usually inconsistent quality and it bothered me a lot ; ;<br>
i felt insecure and confused about posting my pics so many were randomly posted on my tumblr blogs <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
so now, i decided to organize my folders and just kept the beautiful, good quality pics. i deleted a lot of old stuff and even updated the look book page, the "about" pic and the portfolio.<br>
i decided to just make one session for my pictures in the look book and make them temporary ( i usually get tired of looking at old photos at some point so i know they will be deleted sometime ).<br>
this session will be for pictures of myself in general, because i don't really take pics of my looks or my face often, but more "specific" pics. i never knew where to post these here, so now i have a place.<br>
some old pics will be reposted from time to time, so i will not specify dates !<br>
i still don't think i'll post selfies often anyway, and i'll keep taking pictures with pajamas and nightgowns, because as i've said before, it's how i usually feel comfortable.<br>
i still have lots of updates to do about it + i'll post my crafts more often, so stay tuned <sub>📱</sub><br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i also deleted most of my inactive accounts.<br>
i hope these changes haven't been uncomfortable for anyone, i just like to keep things organized <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<br>
so, today's post will be small.. let's go to the text i wrote !!<br>
this is about something i felt the need to talk about but that is not reeeally a subject : about my arguments in my texts in general.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
people who read my huge texts here may notice that my arguments for all subjects have some patterns, i might say, characteristic of me.<br>
i always explain my reasonings to the conclusions, opinions, and "solutions to problems" that i arrive at ; but this doesn't seem to be clear enough to explain why i always think in a specific way and come up with texts that are so deep, sentimental and at the same time logical.<br>
the thing is exactly that ! i take into consideration all the parts that make up who i am. i am a human being who has rationality to be able to reflect on things and observe situations with an "impartial", rational and logical perception ; but i also have feelings, which are what guide me to questioning things and wanting to be happy, helping me and helping those i love, by getting answers to problems. despite having the sentimental side clearly stronger than the rational one, i strive to balance both when thinking about things and also to write my texts, so that i can get more consistent and useful answers. i don't always get it right because i have hormones that affect my cognitive ability from time to time, i'm an animal ( female, which makes me on the other hand get particular facility in other things, which i also try to make the most of ) but i only write my texts when i am in the mood to reach balanced conclusions.<br>
i think what makes the difference in my arguments to most people is that although i know that i am not the most mature and experienced person, not having much knowledge in specific areas, i always look for answers within myself and in the nature, which is what inevitably controls us. we are all composed of mind, body and soul ; our mind carry the ability to rationalize, our body carry feelings and instincts, our soul carry our pure essence. people usually focus on the part they are most comfortable using and form arguments based on that particular part, but that causes problems ; ;<br>
if you just focus on the mind you will make arguments that are insensitive, extreme and that will not bring happiness ; if you focus on the feelings you will make arguments that will not be useful, perhaps childish and very melancholy ; if you focus on the instincts you will make primitive and inconsistent arguments ; if you focus on the soul you will make arguments that are usually religious and too abstract to be understood. what i strive to do is to use the feelings ( which are my strength ) to guide me through the questions, then use all the other parts to form my arguments and respond to the problems consistently and clearly. my arguments are gentle and soft, natural, extremely sincere and even without having great academic background it's not just "all over the place". it's always thought to bring me happy and working responses, even though we are animals and nature is neutral, we can understand and work with it if we use all the parts that make us up properly.<br>
i know that my texts are focused on being personal and may not work for many people because they have opinions of their own, and i always encourage you to reflect personally to find your own answers. anyway, i think my way to get to the arguments in a balanced way is a healthy practice and i recommend it to everyone ♡ !<br>
i'm utterly happy to know that you like to read what i write, since it's something that comes from my heart ( and everything else ).<br>
<br>
well, that's it, i hope i've expressed myself clearly !!<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>👶</sub><br>
i realize how this website has grown since its creation and i am very proud of the progress <sub>🐑</sub><br>
i'm doing my best to bring frequent updates and useful content to you !!<br>
please ask me complex questions to write about, it's hard to think about subjects that seem relevant..<br>
i get many questions that would not really do a good q&a, you know ?<br>
<br>
you know that i have a routine page, i have schedules to do certain things and daily tasks, this helps me a lot to organize things, as well as my weekly listings and schedules.<br>
of course life doesn't always collaborate and we have to make adaptations, but it is great to have a base to know what to do and not waste time.<br>
so, i've been trying hard to spend less time on the internet lately !<br>
if i'm forced to do this i always find a way to do everything in a short time, but it is difficult to have discipline when i have free time ; ;<br>
some of my tasks require the internet, so i defined a period of 3 hours a day as the maaaaximum time on the internet, on those more complicated days ; but i usually spend 2 hours or even 1 hour and i'm very happy about it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
it's a very important practice, especially for those who do many "quiet" activities like me, it is necessary to space these times to stretch, drink water, make snacks and take some air outside.<br>
in fact, i would like to clarify that i don't really wake up 6 am going to sleep 1 am, it would be torture.. <sub>🛏</sub><br>
i just get up to watch the sunrise ( when it's possible, i really like doing it ), so i also eat a fruit and plan my day ; if it's very hot i like to take a shower to refresh, then i go back to sleep until 10 am !<br>
i just really wake up at 6 am if i need to and in that case i always go to bed before midnight.<br>
<br>
i was writing lots of letters lately and thinking.. sometimes i get a little annoyed with my handwriting because it's very... childish <sub>🍮</sub><br>
i don't know how to explain, i don't think it's ugly, it's kinda cute ; but it's a little clumsy, small and "roundy", it's the same handwriting that i see in my old school notebooks !!<br>
if you have already exchanged letters with me or have already seen my handwriting fonts you will understand.<br>
( by the way, if you are interested in exchanging letters don't hesitate to contact me in the email because i love doing this <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> )<br>
i really like calligraphy so i train a lot, i like to write in different letters to make decorated titles and "aesthetic" texts, but my natural handwriting really is childish and there's nothing i can do about it ; ;<br>
they say people's handwriting reflects their personality, i know everyone has a unique handwriting that is a "brand" of them and that's very special <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
but it is impossible not to envy people who have naturally mature and elegant handwriting <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
well, i can "simulate" this if i really want to, but it's not the same since it inevitably doesn't suit me very much so i usually just prefer to be myself.<br>
<br>
enough of talking, today the post will have a super cute drawing that i colored <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>

i know that compared to the last posts full of content this seems a little bit meh but i'm really busy with bigger things right now ..<br>
<br>
today's q&a is something sweet and positive for you <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
hmnfg i hope it doesn't seem pretentious or anything like that <sub>🐇</sub><br>

<br><br>
have you ever seen people who are so beautiful, kind and have a lovely aura that makes everyone feel comfortable and safe around ? it seems like a rare and precious personality trait, like this person knows nothing bad and lives in a beautiful and different reality.<br>
in fact, i have learned over time that this is a skill to be acquired with maturity. bad experiences don't influence who you really are and shouldn't make you have a heavy and sad aura. bad experiences happen for you to mature and to be able to avoid them in the future, as well as helping other people in a similar situation ; traumas are not part of you, all bad things you've been through, you've seen or just know that exist, none of that is part of you and none of that represents your reality.<br>
you should never become ignorant, keep yourself informed of the world situation and mold your opinions is very important to live healthy and safe ! however, it is extremely important to keep yourself pure despite all this. purity will give you a different aura and will make your reality, in fact, beautiful.<br>
don't let bad thoughts and memories affect you continuously ; boring and ugly things are a part of life and you really should deal with them properly and don't ignore them, but you should not make them a personal problem. on daily basis you should forget everything bad and only think of beautiful and pleasant things that you live, lived and would like to live : daydream, watch the sky, pick flowers, write love letters, wear perfume, put on pajamas all day, wear your favorite dress casually ! life has many opportunities for you to make it beautiful and create good memories for you to keep and share with others.<br>
surround yourself with beautiful things, embellish ugly things you don't like to look at, cherish people who love you & move away from people who are toxic to you. small details in your life can greatly help shaping your ability to be positive and emanate kindness and beauty ♡<br>
<br>
remember : the kinder you are, the more beautiful you become ( and that includes being kind to yourself )<br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>🧸</sub><br>
this is a very special month, since it's the 1 year anniversary of middlepot.com<br>
+ i turn 21 years old <sub>💘</sub><br>
i wish i could express in words how much i love this place and how i love to post here !!<br>
it was definitely the best thing i've done to date and i plan to make it better and better for me and you fluffies,<br>
so don't hesitate to send me your opinions and tips <sub>🍪</sub><br>
<br>
the days are going very smoothly and i just baked marshmallows, so i'm a comfy girl ..<br>
i hope everything stays this way until saturday, which is my birthday, because i'll go on a date with my beloved bubu and i want it to be perfect <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font><br>
<br>
this post will be full of soft and cozy things, all in a similar aesthetic that i've been wanting to work with for some time, i recommend you eat something sweet to get into it <sub>🧇</sub><br>
to start, i've made a new page for the aesthetic book !<br>
it's so fun to make these collages, i really want to do it often, if you support me <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

i think this activity is very good for practicing dealing with aesthetics other than my main one, and as i've been aiming to improve my "beautifying" skills i'm doing my best to try different things while maintaining my individuality.<br>
do you think i'm doing well ?<br>

it's soft and friendly, just like a teddy bear, so i think it fits well <sub>☕️</sub><br>
<br>
and talking about teddy bears, i had a sudden idea when i saw my png folder and realized that i had a lot of stuffed animals in there ( 56 specifically )<br>
i had to do something with them urgently, they can't just be homeless and all over the place ..<br>
so i started to make a html page that was comfortable to store them, organizing my virtual stuffie collection !!!<br>

today i want to write some important tips to you who often feel dissociated and confused with your very existence.<br>
it is a very complicated subject, but i know what i'm going to say here is a good introduction to reflections and learning that you will have to follow on your own ; getting started is usually difficult so i'll say the method i chose to better understand myself, my passions and goals.<br>
will i really be able to help someone with these words .. ?<br>
i wish from the bottom of my heart !<br>

<br><br>
i know that the pursuit of self-knowledge is something that never ends, but i, being young, realize that young people usually seek to be special in some way, seeking individuality. the thing is that we are all different and have individualities already, if you don't know which ones you can't enjoy this right, you can't be yourself and improve, so you just become artificial and sad. adults also don't usually know who they are, they just let it go, it makes them more and more faded, which is extremely sad. feeling dissociated and not knowing who you are is a bad feeling and should not be taken to life, so i will try to help you by saying how i managed to understand who i really am and my individuality, i hope it can help some of you too !<br>
something that helped me a lot to understand who i am were the aesthetics. i know this is a very recent term and it may seem rather silly and superficial, but you can call it other things too, since it has always existed : style, spectrum, tendency, essence.. i like to call it aesthetics because i am quite visual, but you must understand that what i mean by that is the essence of who you are, represented through visuals, personality, lifestyle, passions and others.<br>
we are very stimulated seeing beautiful and wonderful things everywhere, aesthetics that we want for ourselves. the problem is that we can not be all things, although we have different moods and personal tastes, there are limits to who we can be ; when you go beyond these limits you feel dissociated and uncomfortable. only you can know who you really are and when you're not being yourself, so you must first learn to understand your feelings and not be carried away by the desires of being someone different, you are perfect being who you are, people are beautiful and perfect in different ways ( and only when they are being themselves ).<br>
you certainly have personal tastes and should not suppress them to fit into groups, your personal tastes help you a lot to understand your personal essence ( we don't really can choose to like things voluntarily, we just like it ). i discovered who i am separating my personal tastes : whenever i had to choose a color, a music, a food, a place, above all others, although i like lots of different things, i always had a specific preference , there was a clear pattern in these things, despite different moods. in this way, through experimentation, i was able to discover my favorite aesthetic. and i must say, you will not find yours coming from someone else, you will only find elements that will compose your personal aesthetic. aesthetics carry specific messages and feelings, so you must understand what you are looking for.<br>
it may seem confusing, but for example, i started by just liking cute, delicate, and feminine things ; within that there may be infinite variations, so i sometimes felt confused and uncomfortable with some cute things that did not really match me. "but i like cute stuff, what's the problem ??" i thought. the problem is that i am me, i am a person, people are complex. i began to realize that i felt artificial when trying to adhere some elements that didn't represent me ( despite being visually alike, carried different feelings ). gradually i separated the elements and composed some aesthetics that i really liked and i felt comfortable about it, until i discovered my ult fav one.<br>
i have a tip for you : always think about the adjectives that define things, these adjectives should complement and make sense to you, should be pleasant and make you feel good ( even the negative ones ). you must do this with all things, not just with visuals, since your essence is present in all the things that make up you.<br>
by understanding who you are, it will be much easier to self improve, you will be able to have healthier relationships and help people, you will have better self esteem, you will better understand your personality ( and therefore take better care of yourself as you will understand your limits ), you will be able to find hobbies, to find out what you want to do with your life, you will be happier and will continue to be free to enjoy things that "don't fit" your main aesthetic, since this is also part of your individuality and should not be denied. as i always say here, you must always seek purity.<br>
i would like to make it clear that you should think about yourself rather than what others feel about you or how other people "should" see you. only you can know yourself deeply and truthfully. people should see you as you really are, you must be yourself and you should not be a walking lie to please others, therefore you will not please anyone or even yourself ! lies are always bad.<br>
<br><br>
i hope my words are useful <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

i've been feeling so in love these days <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>

i want today's q&a to be useful to some of you, although it is a personal reflection, i know it is also a subject not much thought and discussed, so i think it's good to share with you <sub>🦋</sub><br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i think it's really important to write about it because it's something that has disturbed me all my life and i've always kept quiet about it because no one would take it seriously anyway.<br>
people live by money, they act as if money is everything in life. even if they pretend they don't, they always think of money in the first place ( of course, until they have real problems in their lives and money doesn't help ).<br>
ever since i was little i have always been bothered by the importance that all adults gives to money, but they have always told me " you will understand when you grow up ". well, i grew up, and reflecting a lot on what i want to do with my life, i definitely know that i do not want to live looking for money until my death.<br>
how important is money to our lives ? to begin with, we are living beings, so we must survive in the first place. to survive, we need food, water, shelter, medicine, cleaning products, clothes... nowadays it is also quite necessary to have electricity.<br>
secondly, we need to be happy, of course, because we have feelings and we think a lot about things, so we need to feel satisfied ! i believe that to be happy is a very personal thing, but in general we need to have peace in our hearts. this is not bought for money, of course. we need to feel comfortable and complete, the pursuit of this is different for each person. in general, we want the presence of people we love in our lives, and this may need money, but not so much, usually the longing is caused more by the lack of time or health of people. some people seek happiness through material goods, which may indeed be quite amusing, but should never be treated as essential because it is not. never. it's the silly, futile thing to expect to be happy, to be sad for the lack of material goods is totally meaningless if you think about it.<br>
sure, then to be happy it's not necessary to have much money but rather own knowledge and inner peace ; but we need money to survive. of course you can't just run away from money if you were born into society. if you live in a big city, you need to pay bills to have water, shelter and electricity, you need to go to the market to buy food and cleaning products, you have to spend money on medicines and hospitals, you have to buy clothes ! well, it is possible to avoid much of this if you live in the countryside and can have water and food and even produce electricity, because we are intelligent human beings and we have nature in our favor, with effort we can enjoy it a lot. but you will still need money for other things.<br>
i know what i'm writing are obvious things, but people don't usually think about them, which makes them very confused about life and how money should be used and what it really is for. it exists to be exchanged for important things that we can not produce alone, that we need the help of other people. we can't do everything on our own, and so humans live collectively, to help each other and to fulfill our needs, so we can survive much longer and have time to be happy. or so it should be, of course. things go wrong when people forget what is important to them and what they want and like to do. people can not be happy because they think only of money and what they have been taught to do.<br>
to make money we need to help other people by doing something they want to pay for. there are many options for this, some are more stable and some less stable. there are many reasons for this, i do not know much about economics, politics or anything like that, but in my view one of the reasons is because some forms of work are extremely indirect, you are not helping anyone really, maybe even being a nuisance. this makes your job a bit pointless, so it's easily disposable and replaceable. people think of this part ( the job ) as super important to their lives and ironically treat it in the worst possible way : they think about what can make more money, neither what makes them happy nor other people happy. money should never be the focus of your life, since this job will be something that will occupy a good part of your life and should be something that helps other people, it should be something pleasurable, rewarding. you can choose from endless options of jobs, why choose to be a slave to money or have a purposeless and unstable work ? i just can't understand.<br>
obviously many things that we enjoy so so so much are things that are not so useful to others and do not give much money, so we call them hobbies. i would not recommend trying to make a hobbie-type your source of money to survive, as that would give you extreme instability in life and make you very frustrated not to have the work valued. some people can actually make it work, but to have the time and dedication to make it happen it is necessary to survive in that period. if you are supported by someone, you can do this, but it is indeed complicated. BUT it doesn't mean that you should stop with your hobbies or treat them as something small in any way, they are still important, just not your main job.<br>
thinking about all these things made me define what i want to do with my life ( the answer was the simplest, since these are things i always wanted to do, i just needed to figure out if this would work, of course ) : i definitely do not want to be a slave to money, i will never think of money as something to give life and happiness. i just want to do things that i like and i'm proud to do. that doesn't mean it will be easy, i'm going to have a lot of work and i'm going to try hard to make it work, but with a bright smile on my face !<br>
i want to live a little away from the city, because i want to plant and raise animals. i have several plans on this and i know it's rather complex, but i've been planning a lot for several years, since it's something i've always wanted to do since i was little. i can tell you the details about some things if you want, of course, only practice can teach me what this kind of life can offer me, but it's really what i want. and i never thought it was something that could give me money since i always grew up having my dreams devalued and being encouraged to work on boring things to have money. i'm glad i never took it seriously and i always followed my heart.<br>
i already told you that i want to have a café, right ? so, this is part of the whole thing. having a craft store is the part where my hobbies are included, since i do not want to abandon them !<br>
money, being something quite vague and used only to buy important things that help us survive and possibly have extra entertainment, is something that at the moment i am exclusively using with the intention of realizing my dreams and having a source of happy income and stability. in the future, i know that i will have money to also buy beautiful things and travel, but that will only be because i worked hard and made the right choices : i chose to follow my heart, to help people and to be happy.<br>
do not choose to live for the money, do not be sad because of money, never !!!<br>
<b>edit //</b> my life plans have changed a little bit since i first written this text, so i'm going to update you !! now that my store + web design are my main income, i have found a lot of happiness in working online, and i want to grow my brand even further by making more products and games with my loved fluffy characters ♡<br>
that being said, i've made the choice ( at least for now ) that i want this café idea to be an online café, instead of a real place. even though i like baking, my idea was more like a comforting place to hangout with friends safely and make happy memories ! i will make this idea come to reality soon, with my new online game projects.<br>
<br><br>
i hope this helps you to reflect on your life choices and think about whether you are really choosing happiness.<br>
i know a lot of young people read my blog, so i really wish you were not influenced by the sad, greedy adults around you ; ;<br>
um and i'm sorry if i wrote too much unnecessarily <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

<br>
for today's q&a i decided to write about a rather controversial topic,,<br>
i, indeed, feel a bit of apprehension. but i believe you will understand my point of view <sub>🌼</sub><br>
( please consider that this is the way i feel comfortable about dealing with it within my lifestyle )<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
because of some things i've said before, people ask me about this : i'm not vegan, but i'm trying my best to be 100% cruelty-free !<br>
( i understand the consequences of the environmental impact of consuming certain products that i consume, but i am talking about what i feel and think about the consumption of these products in a specific and personal way )<br>
veganism is not just about diet but also about products and lifestyle. i am completely in favor of using only cruelty-free products, which are not tested on animals, anything that is not natural and causes suffering is something i completely repudiate. having a healthy and natural lifestyle is something that i try hard to have ! well, i support all that part of veganism about being cruelty-free, but not the part of the diet. it's something very personal, so please don't take it as a criticism, it's just what i believe.<br>
i'll start with the meat : i don't think eating meat is anything wrong, cruel or bad to do. it's a natural part of life and i see no problems about killing to feed. obviously, this goes a long way, since humans are not necessarily carnivorous, and we also have the rationality to avoid such things, but meat was ( and still is ) a very important part of the diet of most humans. not all people can really avoid the meat and replace it, it's very cultural and complicated. my biggest problem with meat is the cruelty involved in the process, animals that are bred only to die and live miserably, it makes me very sad and angry. a second problem are the hormones given to the animals so they grow up faster, it's extremely bizarre and disgusting, it does SO bad for the health of anyone !! for these reasons, i am seeking to limit myself to just eating meat from animals that have been properly reared, with a healthy, natural life, as was formerly the case. this is hard to find and also very expensive, but like i said, we do not need meat to survive anymore, so i think it's very plausible. i just can't eat meat from tortured animals like it's normal.<br>
<b>edit //</b> my thoughts on eating meat have changed quite a bit since i first wrote this text. i still don't think that eating meat is a bad thing to do itself, but as rational animals we can make choices, and i know that i am in a position where i can choose not to eat meat, so i am deliberately choosing to kill animals, right ?<br>
if the animal has lived a happy and healthy life while it can, it is difficult to say whether it is cruel or not to take that life away from it. maybe it’s not so bad for him, if it’s a quick death. i personally wouldn't mind living until middle age having everything i need to be happy, and then being killed for a good cause. the thing is : killing to eat, when you don’t need to eat meat at all, is it a good cause ??<br>
i started to see the cowardice in taking an animal's life indirectly, when i put myself in the place of who would kill. when i imagined killing my loved cats to eat. they lived a happy life, but for me their lives are too precious and eating them would be horrible ..<br>
however, not everyone thinks so. i personally have no problem killing fish ( i have fished and felt nothing different than harvesting vegetables, for example ) so i believe it depends a lot on each person and i do not judge the opinion of others. i've been trying to take responsibility for "killing" what i'm eating, so if i wouldn't kill / participate in the process personally, in my view i have no right to eat that !<br>
it's hard to change habits, for rational animals we can be very ignorant.. talking about what we consume and how it affects the world in general is important, but we need practical solutions when it comes to fixing habits. if each person had to kill an animal before eating its meat, i'm sure most people would be more responsible about their choices, since you could avoid it just eating something else nowadays.<br>
now, about milk and milk products in general, there is a big controversy about whether milk is bad or good for people's health. milk is obviously the most important food for a baby, but that is breast milk. the milk of other animals is not really needed for us, but if eaten properly, it can be very healthy. the milk can not be consumed in large quantities, but i don't think that it does bad unless you have some intolerance or allergy ( which is quite common, but not everyone has ). for me, the biggest problem about milk is how animals are treated horribly and full of hormones, same problems as meat. so i have to really do a lot of research to find good sources.<br>
about eggs, it's a very important part of the human diet since ever, but of course, it can be replaced. however i have no problems with eggs, just with the treatment of animals, just like the above cases, i look for good sources.<br>
commenting briefly, wearing fur and animal hide is horrible when they kill animals only for the luxury of vain humans. the skin and leather removed from animals that were killed for food is not something i see problem ( although i have problem with rearing animals in most cases, as i said earlier ). the skin of animals that died in natural ways is something i have nothing against !<br>
finally, i want to comment on honey, which is somewhat controversial among people who adhere to veganism. i am not against honey or beekeeping, bees do not suffer in the process, it's quite the contrary, they live much better by having humans protecting them. they produce much more honey than they need, and using this extra honey is not wrong. the problem with beekeeping is that it should not be done all over the world, and it is. honeybees should not be living all over the world, but humans carried them everywhere, just for convenience. typical ignorant selfishness. the problem still is not for the bees but for other animals, other pollinators are extremely harmed by having their habitat invaded by bees that should not be there. different types of bees are natural from specific places. i support the breeding of bees in their proper habitats ( in reasonable quantities, obviously, the overpopulation of bees is not good anywhere ). this is not so difficult to find, since you can know the source of the honey you buy. depending on where you live, if it's one of the appropriate places, there may be local creators you can support ! research is the key for a good lifestyle.<br>
<br><br>
um, as usual, i didn't intend to write that much ; ;<br>
but i hope you understand my point <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍦</sub><br>
many new things are coming soon !!<br>
as you may know, some of my projects have been standing for some time because of some important things i've been doing lately. i'm actually quite busy with these things, but i've been reflecting on all my projects and realized that i should not let them totally stand still for so long. they all exist for a reason and keeping them active would help me a lot to practice my skills in different areas, after all they were created to motivate me to study and always be using my creativity ! also, they have a story behind, i care for them.<br>
i always value my hobbies because they make me happy, even if i know i'm not so talented at everything i do, i think it's worth doing my best to keep doing it. i will continue updating all my projects even if it is with a lower frequency ; being occupied with other things is not a justification to abandon them !<br>
i'm feeling pretty motivated so i'm certainly updating all my projects.<br>
<br>
so, maybe you have seen that i posted a new html stuff..<br>
 an aesthetic virtual journal <sub>📚</sub><br>
i had this idea randomly when i was doing collage. i love doing this and i always have several journals with different aesthetics, stationery is one of my big passions ! i also like to put pieces of fabric, ribbons, buttons, even beautiful packaging.<br>
i've always wanted to somehow do this digitally, but i have never really tried, until now. it's actually easy, and a lot of fun <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
i took the opportunity to offer you some cute thematic materials that you can use for decoration, digitally or even printed. not all the stuff that i offer in these packs are mine, these are just things that i have saved here, so if anyone doesn't want their content to be included please let me know <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
i intend to keep making new pages, so stay tuned <sub>💻</sub><br>
the domain is cute ( aes.pooftie.me ) and i'll leave a backup file for every page i make :<br>

<br><br>
so.. this may seem like another personal q&a, but i consider it more as an important observation about how you see me and also other people.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i would like to vent some things because i receive several messages and i know that although i am not of great influence, i still have responsibility with people who expect things from me and see me as an example in any aspect. it's natural that you overestimate me, since i'm on the internet and just post my best ; but it's important that i be modest & honest enough with you so this is not a problem and make you have the wrong idea about me ///<br>
everything i'll write here i hope you also remember when observing other people :<br>
i usually say my personal opinion on these q&a texts. this is important to note, because although i always hope to be helping someone to think about these issues, i never expect you to agree with what i say or assume as correct. is my opinion, my point of view, the way i thought to get where i am today. tomorrow i can change, and i hope so. if i change, i will tell you my new thoughts. you may have a completely different view of the things i write here and be happy in your own way, but at least for me it is always good to see other people's sincere opinions to refine mine. read my texts as an external opinion, think carefully about it and think about your own opinions.<br>
i am not perfect. that's obvious, but people tend to think girls on the internet are perfect. i can say that i always do my best and i work hard every day for this. i'm not super talented in most of the things i do and so i'm always studying and practicing. i post the best i do, even if not super good or important things, because i like to receive criticism. it helps me a lot to improve ! my own opinion can help me, since i'm a perfectionist, but sometimes we're just tired and let it go, you know. i can say that i am today the best and most perfect that i could be, within my experiences and reality. tomorrow i'll be better, and so on. if i have to be an example to someone, i want to be an example of motivation, because you should never copy others and try to be like them, you have to be yourselves and the best you can be in this way !<br>
i would also like to talk about my appearance, even though i rarely post pictures of myself, this is a serious topic, since the biggest negative influence that internet girls give others is their perfect ( super edited ) photos and the lack of integrity in saying they are not perfect in real life...<br>
so, about me, being quite honest, i think i am pretty. other people have always said that i am pretty, but that doesn't seem true until i clear my mind ; i like almost everything about my appearance, what took time to happen, since i have my insecurities as well. i still have some things about myself that i would like to improve, and i intend to do so in the future. although i take great care of my skin, it is very sensitive and i usually have allergies from time to time, so i have some spots that i could not repair on my own. there are procedures to help with this, but they are a little expensive, so at the moment i just accepted, these are marks of difficulties that my skin has gone through, that's okay. and i'm very lucky because all the skin that is exposed, like my face, has no marks, so it's something that only those who know me more intimately have already seen ; ;<br>
obviously, anyway, my skin may look like porcelain in the pictures, but in real life it's normal skin, i have pores, you know.. i take care of it a lot and i have to clean and moisturize every day to keep it nice, just like everyone else ! i do not wear makeup often and i always use sunscreen, so i think this helps a lot. i can talk more about skin care in another post, as well as about makeup i use.<br>
my pictures are pretty blurry and have filters, not only because my camera is really bad, but also because i like to make the pictures a little blurry to soften everything and to use filters to adjust the lighting. i do it with all the pictures, not just those of my face, if you notice. when i have a better camera, i can try to take more natural pictures, i would like to try !<br>
last, but not less important, numbers : numbers are not something you should ever take as a basis for success, numbers are extremely inconsistent and are not always real people. even the numbers you can see on my website may seem like a big deal, but they are not consistent as well, since they count the same ips over and over again. and this a problem that exists even on large websites, or do you really think millions, billions of people watched the same video as you ? then, you should only consider real people, always. and a large amount of public is not always something to be proud of, since many people who are not good, lie a lot & are toxic, have many fans. always think of those people who send you sincere, truthful messages that not only praise you but also want you to improve as a person. these messages are what i always consider important and i love receiving them ! i get sad about receiving rude messages, especially when they don't make sense, but even some rude messages can help me mature and improve. i always ask people to be kind to each other, but if i made you angry for any reason, do not hesitate to tell me the reasons, because i don't want to hurt anyone, i am always open to improving and learning new things. i'm no better than neither of you, i'm just better than myself every passing day. we're all here to help each other, not to act superior !!<br>
never support people who make you intentionally feel inferior and less capable than them, who make you feel ugly and useless. you can always be a great person, smart, mature, beautiful, you have the right to have hobbies ( even if you're not so talented right now ) ; you can be perfect, within your reality. your personality may not be 100% ideal, but you're sure to find the balance so this will not get in the way of you improving and being a good person. be pure, be yourself, always ♡<br>
( oh, and, it's okay to feel sad and negative sometimes, making mistakes is normal, we just have to work hard not to keep it that way )<br>
<br><br>
did my huge text help motivate you in any way ? i hope so ..<br>
<br>

<br>
well for this post i also have a q&a !<br>
i want to stop writing many personal topics in a row.. but it's fine, this is my personal blog after all.<br>
this is just out of curiosity : a text about my name !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>

<br>
melissa is my irl name. i really like my name, but i don't use it on the internet because it would be difficult to find me, you know. melissa is the name of a plant, the lemon balm. it is common for people to use this plant to make tea and for medicinal purposes. it has very small, white and delicate flowers. the meaning of this name is literally "honeybee", which makes people give some interesting interpretations to it. some people gave me the nickname "mel" ( which means literally honey ).
<br>
<br>
　<sub>🖇</sub> <font color="#91816b">𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑡</font>
<br>
this is actually a surname, and i use it as "artistic signature" on my commercial works and accounts. i've used some variations of it ( midpot, mimipot ) in the past. it's not a real surname, i discovered it in a dream. at the time i was thinking of a nickname to use on the internet and i had just created the "poofties" project, so i was thinking about many things and characters, especially potatoes. i used the nickname "poteto" from time to time, because of that. one day i dreamed about potatoes and many other confusing things, including a very fat and giant cat that called me "melissa middlepot". he told me "you're bigger than your potato friends, but there are still bigger potatoes, believe me", even though i was not really a potato. well, i woke up really thinking that middlepot was good, it sounds like some english surnames. so, yes, i believe that "pot" is from "potato". be honest, "middlepot" is pretty cute, isn't it ?
<br>
<br>
　<sub>🖇</sub> <font color="#91816b">𝑝𝑢𝑓 / 𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑖𝑒</font>
<br>
puf is not just a nickname but actually a character from the poofti world, therefore, a pooftie. it's who i am, there ! middlepot is the surname that was given for me, but they don't call me like this, because it's too formal.. they neither call me melissa / mel ; they call me puf !<br>
puf is a "softie", a metamorphic critter that can take the form of anything that is "soft" enough. it is often seen in the form of a teddy bear, bunny, lamb, or human girl ! sometimes a mix between these .. sometimes with wings, but it cannot fly. puf can't control its metamorphosis abilities, it happens suddenly and without explanation.<br>
i like to use its name and variations as user in my "casual" accounts ! small and cute.<br><br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this hasn't been too boring to read ..<br>

where do you live, is it getting hot or cold ?<br>
here is a super nice climate, a gentle cold, soft sunlight + the rains have stopped completely. it's my favorite weather season !!<br>
for those who remember the past post, my trip with bubu was magical, i would like to travel with him all the time <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font><br>
it's not usual for me to travel, i sometimes spend years without leaving nearby. i want to travel a lot in the future <sub>🦋</sub><br>
<br>
i made a new playlist recently, for asmr / comfort. i've been thinking about making it for some time, since i usually watch a lot of asmr channels that are not very well known and many videos that i like are asmr not intentional. you will find all kind of stimmy and aesthetically pleasing videos !<br>
most videos are from japanese and korean channels, but some videos are in english and portuguese.<br>
i hope this playlist will help you relax and discover new content !!<br>
maybe you can even learn to make some recipes <sub>🍰</sub><br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>❤️</sub><br>
i would like to thank once again the support you give me, it is really very special for me !!<br>
the ideas you give me are very useful and i never tire of saying thank you <sub>💐</sub><br>
because of my routine post yesterday i received some messages thanking the inspiration for organization and productivity, but i also received some rather sad messages saying that they couldn't be productive or follow schedules like me.<br>
i would like to clarify that although schedules are important, it is not always possible to follow them.<br>
sometimes i go to sleep later than i intended, sometimes i wake up with a headache, i don't force myself to go beyond my limits <sub>🛏</sub><br>
everyone has different limits, you don't have to do multiple tasks every day, you don't have to wake up at 6:30 am, it's different for every person !<br>
your routine should be tailored to your lifestyle and your chores and hobbies should be things that you feel good doing, and i didn't include household chores in the routine because they vary according to need,,<br>
but i have these as well, every day <sub>🎁</sub><br>
it's important to be productive but it's also important to stay healthy and happy, never forget !<br>
<br>
soooooo, i'm super happy these days because tomorrow, day 5, me and bubu have completed 5 years of dating <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!!<br>
we're going to take a little trip together and i'm super extremely excited and i dream about it every day !!<br>
i love him so so so so so much <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font><br>
<br>
so,, because of yesterday's very personal post with information about my personality, some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it.<br>
i'll add these in the faq :<br>
<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my height is 168cm ( 5'6 ft ). i am medium sized.<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　i weight 50kg ( 110 lbs ) .<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　i don't want to share measurements here, but i really like my body shape ! according to my measures, i'm hourglass figure.<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my skin is pale, but not super pale. i hate tanning because my skin is really sensitive and turns red only ; ;<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my hair changes color very much according to the lighting, but it also becomes clearer if i go out in the sun. it's dark blond / light brown and sometimes it gets a little bit orange, but it's only noticeable in the sunlight.<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs ( it's cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs ). i cut my hair myself. i'm lazy so it's common for my bangs to be super long + my hair is quite wavy, so the cut is not so noticeable.<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my eyes are between blue and green ( cyan, turquoise ) + a little bit grayish.<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　i don't know my shoe size to be honest, but my feet are 23cm.<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　um... i'm a-cup <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<br>
... of course i would not leave the post with just that, it would be shameful.<br>
i have something much more important to post on today's q&a, super very extremely important :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not you think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ♡ !<br>
<br>
i really hope it touched your heart !<br>
<br>

aaaa <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font> i'm so thankful for the cute messages i've received lately !!<br>
you all are so kind to me, i don't deserve it ..<br>
also, i love it when you send me suggestions. i like to post things you want to see !<br>
<br>
um, so, do you remember that i was training to be ambidextrous ?<br>
i think i can consider that i already got there !!<br>
i really can't believe how fast that was, i thought it would take a long time <sub>🖋</sub><br>
i am training every day using my left hand to do day-to-day tasks, and to write.<br>
i'd say i can do things 80% the same way with my left hand now !<br>
and i can write with the same handwriting, but it's a bit slower ( i never can write too fast anyway )<br>
well, i am very proud of the progress <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
<br>
today the post will be a little more personal, since you have been asking for some little things <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
these days i was writing down my routine, as usual. i usually write down daily task lists, but i always had some items that i repeated every day.<br>
for ease, i wrote down these items in a txt, which i kept for a while. it was not very cute, so i thought i should write it somewhere else ...<br>
i was in the mood to do some pretty cute html page, so i did one with some things from my routine !!<br>
it was quite spontaneous, i was not even going to show it to anyone at first.<br>
but as you asked for some more personal things like that, and it was so cute, i decided to post !<br>
and with a super cute url ( day.pooftie.me ), of course <sub>💻</sub><br>
i will leave here a backup file, as always :<br>

it's in portuguese because.. well, i'm actually going to use it on a day-to-day basis and like i said, it was written spontaneously.<br>
i hope you don't mind ; ;<br>
<br>
so, because of the other post where i say that i don't like people to "guess" my personality through tests, astrology, blood type or anything, you asked me to post things about my personality.<br>
i'm actually quite honored that you really care about me that way, it's very sweet <sub>💗</sub><br>
i thought about it for a while, i don't really like to talk about myself so deeply, but since this is a more personal post... here it is :<br>

<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i'm very shy & introverted. so, because of my introversion, i don't feel bad for being shy, it's just part of me ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i'm full of love and i do my best to take care of others and myself. i want to bring comfort and safety to everyone !<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i have difficulties in approaching and sometimes i never feel comfortable near some people ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　when i'm comfortable with people, i talk a lot about random things, sometimes i even talk too much <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i usually adapt to different situations and different people "changing moods", sometimes i get into it a lot and i feel confused, but i'm always myself ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i'm always evaluating my behavior to improve myself, but sometimes i take it too seriously and get overwhelmed ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i love rules ! i love to make rules for myself, to have rules made for me and to follow them. rules often make me happy because they make me a better person ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i make lists all the time to be able to have an organized routine and take time to practice all my hobbies. feeling busy with things that i like makes me feel pretty satisfied !<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i think too much about everything and sometimes i feel melancholic ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i deeply value the purity. for me purity is directly linked to your true personality, who you really are. i never forget who i am and what i believed and wanted from myself when i was a child and i want more than anything to be proud of myself, the child i will always be.<br>
<br>
　　　　　<font color="#91816b">𝓮𝓍𝓉𝓇𝒶</font> ..<br>
<br>

<sub>🎗</sub>　my main interest is beautiful things and to make things beautiful ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i like everything that warms my heart and i try to fill my life with these things ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　people say i smell like vanilla. i think i smell like honey <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i love animals, especially babies, i love taking care of babies <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i love nature, she is everything to me, i struggle daily to feel part of her and understand my instincts and role in life. this has made me extremely happy and helps me overcome any personal problems.<br>
<br>
.. that's it <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hmpf, i've been super anxious these days, which has decreased my productivity <sub>🌧</sub><br>
i'm trying hard to keep on doing my tasks, persistence is very important !!<br>
i always feel like a very good girl when i finish doing what i have to do <sub>🎗</sub><br>

day 8 is bubu's birthday !!!! <sub>🍰</sub><br>
i'm obviously going to make surprises for him and prepare something very special. i'm so excited !!<br>

i'm going to show you today some of the first things i've embroidered, my favorite ones :<br>

i think it turned out really cute and good images to use as graphics !<br>
i've been embroidering a lot lately, but these are the first ones i did, so it's more special.<br>
<br>
for today's q&a the subject will be very... heavy.<br>
i don't know if it's appropriate for you if you're a minor, but i would say that it is something very important and needs to be talked about. i'll be careful !

the sєxualization is a very controversial subject. it can be seen as horrible, beautiful, okay, or even as an art form. it can be beautiful, but it can also be dangerous. there is a fine line between healthy and unhealthy sєxuality, which causes people to be often completely in favor or against. i think there are big limits to it.<br>
sєxual content and pσrnography is very dangerous because often this industry involves people being harmed and abusєd, and make sєx seem vulgar and casual. this becomes an addiction and is totally wrong, it ruins you, makes you have a lot of problems and mess up your whole life !!<br>
this goes a long way from kιnks and different forms of sєxuality, it's about self-respect, safety, happiness, purity and health.<br>
i personally consider that people who are involved with pσrnography and prσstitution ( even on the internet ) are often source of many problems, for themselves and for many others ( even children ) and i totally do not support this industry. i am not exactly against drawings and animations, for they are not real people ( when it comes especially to art, i support quite as well as artistic nudity in any case ). but, this type of content still has moral limits and should be reserved for adults, always.<br>
pubєrty is the time when we should be very careful about sєxuality, because it is not the moment to do it, but it's natural to be curious and very important to be educated about it. repressed sєxuality is often degenerate. many children at pubєrty become hypersєxualized and even not having sєx, come very close to it several times and with several different people. they can often develop weird kιnks and even support pedσphilia. they get hurt and traumatized for a lifetime, even hurting other people in the process.<br>
<br>
the excessive sєxualization can bring hypersєxualization to people, which is very dangerous for their lives.<br>
the sєx itself is not impure, since we're animals and it's healthy and natural to have sєxuality.<br>
but sєx is not only for having babies but also for pleasure. this is when it gets dangerous.<br>
using food as an example : there are delicious foods that are healthy and some that are bad for our bodies and even if food is essential for our survival, consuming too much food can destroy our lives. everything has limits.<br>
hypersєxuality can lead to need for casual sєx, and it is always a problem because the more you do, the more you want to do. this in addition to being able to bring diseases, is dangerous, not healthy and bad for your mind.<br>
this is a major problem of early sєxuality, since children do not have a safe way to have sєx. it's always wrong, harmful and traumatic for them.<br>
it's very super important that sєxuality be brought in a healthy way to make everyone happy. treating it as wrong and dirty does not help in this process !!<br>
the right sєx would be not necessarily to make babies, but the one we do healthfully often and only with people we trust. the sєx with whom we love is infinitely better and makes you and the other person happy. it doesn't hurt anyone, it doesn't make you sad, it's pure, safe and comfortable. makes you feel loved. there is no way to be something bad !<br>
<br>
so take care of yourselves, please, it will do miracles to your mental health. i promise.<br>
i really hope my words are easy to understand !<br>
<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>☂️</sub><br>
the rain doesn't stop, day in day out .. it's starting to get boring, honestly.<br>
i'm reading a lot about gardening these days <sub>🌷</sub><br>
i've had a lot of trouble because the super humid weather of the season is making them bad ; ;<br>
if you have any suggestions, i would appreciate it !!<br>
<br>
so, this is a little random, but i want to share it with you ,,<br>
since i was little i always wanted to be ambidextrous, because it seems to be an incredible and useful ability !<br>
i've always been too lazy to start practicing, but now i'm really training my left hand ( i'm right-handed ), and it has not been that hard.<br>
writing is, as expected, the hardest part <sub>🖋</sub><br>
taking advantage of my interest in calligraphy, i'm training every day and it's been a lot of fun, i'm improving fast !!<br>
i feel even sorry for having underestimated my left hand all this time <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
( oh i also have trained my sleep, sleeping and waking up every day at the same time. it was always hard for me, but bubu is encouraging me and i'm doing very well ! )<br>
by the way, have you seen the new fonts i made, with my handwriting ?<br>
i really really liked the result, even if they have some spacing problems .. i think it's still ok !<br>
you can download it on my portfolio, and use anywhere you like <sub>💖</sub><br>
<br>
this post is a little small, but i have lots for the next ones..<br>
see you soon ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

hiii fluffies <sub>💓</sub><br>
i would like to thank you for the latest messages, i'm very happy to answer each one of them <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
your suggestions and opinions are always very important to me.<br>
it's truly unbelievable that this site actually has been visited almost 15 million times !!!<br>
<br>
it's rainy season here and bubu bought me a new cute umbrella <sub>🌧</sub><br>
.. i love bubu so much, he makes me so happy, i can't help myself, i have to tell everyone !!!<br>
these days i have worked hard to learn how to cook and bake, i really feel like making delicious things in our future house <sub>🏠</sub><br>
<br>
umm i have something super very special that i found and despite having exited a lot to post here because i am extremely shy with my voice, i think it's worth it, because i worked hard !<br>
that's from a couple of years ago, when i was part of a small cover group with some friends. i had a very bad microphone, so i got a new one and recorded some songs and my friend edited.<br>
i'm very shy, so i didn't show to many people besides them and it ended up getting lost in time. luckily, i backed up this specific song, my fav one. i decided to post here today :<br>
<br>
<br><br>

</font></font></font>
<br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br>
i don't have the microphone anymore, but i'd like to buy another. i don't think i'd record more songs because it's really hard for me, but maybe i could talk to you fluffies ?<br>
i think it might be a good idea, please give me suggestions !!<br>
<br>
so, i'm not going to do a q&a today, sorry ; ;<br>
but i have something stuck in my throat and i really need to vent :<br>
<br>
please : <b>stop spreading hate</b> !!!!!!<br>
i've seen a lot of people all over internet spreading hate to feel better about their problems, and hate is NEVER the solution !<br>
hating people will not help you or make you a better person, it's immature and very very bad !<br>
writing about solutions, about what you think it's bad and must be helped ( almost everything can be helped if you try your best ) is important, but hating people is just not right !<br>
how do you expect things to get better by making other people hate you because you hate them !?<br>
nature is sure to teach you to value the really important things in life, and you can be sure that it is not internet drama.<br>
please, be kinder <sub>🩹</sub><br>

i don't mind if you identify with them too ! i don't take it that seriously.<br>
( please don't call me by their names, because i don't like it.. )<br>
<br>
<br>
now, the subject i want to talk about is something that i think is extremely important, since i have seen it makes many people insecure, including me, and that was my conclusion about it :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
there's always a beauty competition between different people, races, species and even non-existencial things, and this is honestly so unhealthy !!<br>
there's even a thing called 2.5D wich is "almost non-real pretty" people. i think the desire of being perfect is normal, but it's also dangerous.<br>
people who know how to be beautiful in their best capacity, as healthy and captivating human beings, are really the ones who manage to be almost non-real, so you don't have to be artificial for it. if you try to be perfect you will fail because it's not possible. don't push the limits, just be yourself ! be the best version of yourself, the best you can be, always.<br>
you can't compare yourself with things you'll never be, it's very unhealthy. everything has totally diferent kind of beauties. 2D characters for example are usually made to be pretty besides they usually are not realistic enough to have the details that normal people have, so it's natural that you wanna be like that too. but we are made by nature itself. everything in nature is different and beautiful in its own way, and so are you. we are part of the nature. you don't have to worry about it, at all, because you don't have to be the perfect pretty to be happy.<br>
i think it's also very important to say that your body don't need to be pretty to keep you healthy and alive, and that's the more important thing ! beauty does not make you a good person, you have to work on it.<br>
beauty exist in many ways, i know it may sound cliché, but the inner beauty will really make you more and more beautiful to everyone, including to yourself.<br>
it's okay if you want to look at the mirror and be pleased, we like beautiful things. but it's not that hard. everyone have beauty parts to look at and feel happy. what people say it's pretty, it's not necessarily true for everyone. a good example is fashion, design and aesthetics : everyone have a different taste, even if it's more common to like some kind of clothes and aesthetics, maybe you like some things that are uncommon. it's the same thing, and that's why everything can be beautiful in some way ! you are beautiful in lots of ways, and if you don't believe it, just try to find things that make you happy about yourself and focus on that things !<br>
there's a special beauty in everyone. you are unique, and the cute features you have are purely luck, that's super special ! also, you can be even prettier if you work on being a better person every day, a perfect version of what it's possible for you to be. for example, there are small things that automatically make us feel more beautiful sometimes ( as fashion and makeup ). the most important thing is to feel comfortable and keep healthy. be proud of your race, your species and your existence. be proud of being you !<br>
<br>
please, think about it, because we usually forget some important points that would make us truly happier !!<br>
be kind to yourself <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

i'm melting completely .. summer makes me so uncomfortable ;;<br>
it has been raining a lot, too. it's not the kind of nice rain you can get out with cute umbrellas and have fun, i'm talking about very scary thunderstorms !! <sub>☂️</sub><br>
i wish the summer were not so extreme here ...<br>
it's difficult to do anything in this climate, but i colored some little things that i'll show here today :<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<center><img width="350px" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/QWs36om.png"/></center>

<br><br>
those are from the paper doll mate coloring book <sub>🎗</sub><br>
i love it sooooo much <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
<br>
so, today, i want to talk about a very important subject that i've been dealing with for years and it certainly bothers me a lot ; ;<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i am very interested in astrology and any other "pseudoscience", as well as personality tests, i usually read a lot about it.<br>
but i honestly don't like to talk about that kind of thing, not a little bit. the reason is that most of the time people think they can know everything about others from small information. this is obviously not true and makes me feel very uncomfortable and dissociated seeing people trying to know things about me without knowing me ! it's almost disrespectful, to be honest.<br>
i will not go into other subjects, i will just talk about astrology here, which is a very good example :
astrology is something very complex. people have birth charts, there are signs for each planet, alignments, houses, many details to study.<br>
astrologers study a lot to learn to correctly interpret and evaluate a birth chart, a very relevant example of how a chart can have diverse interpretations is that twins have identical birth charts, but may have completely different personalities.<br>
each person manifests parts of the chart differently, there is no standard for this. people, even so, make very heavy conclusions about others from just a few details of a person's birth chart. i think this is just so wrong, indeed annoying !<br>
for this reason, i do not like to talk about astrology or other similar subjects with almost anyone, i will not show you my birth chart here ever and i kindly ask you that please don't share stereotyped information about my solar sign with me, this makes me very sad.<br>
<br>
i hope you understand my point !<br>
i don't judge people who identify 100% with their solar signs and like this kind of stereotyped information, it just is not my case and i think it's bad that people don't respect it ..<br>
please be kind to others !!<br>
<br>
