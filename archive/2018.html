hiiiii fluffies <sub>🍓</sub><br>
do you have the xmas spirit ? <sub>🎁</sub><br>
i'm willing to bring this comfort and warmth to you through this post <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
as you know, where i live is summer right now, which is very anticlimatic ; ;<br>
i always have difficulties getting into the xmas mood,<br>
but i love the xmas SO much !!!!<br>
i always start to live it as soon as halloween is over ( i really love halloween too, by the way )<br>
one of my biggest dreams is to have a white xmas. i really hope for the day when i will have my first white xmas, and maybe, all the next ones too !<br>
the snow is something magical that i really need to see..
it's so important to me, i can't explain <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
i wish i could see nature in all its splendor, in its completeness...<br>
if you can have snow where you live, i know that you maybe is used it, but please enjoy this vision and live this experience having in mind that it is something really special !!<br>
<br>
changing the subject, i've been thinking a lot about how i take criticism into consideration, but i especially pay close attention to negative criticism..<br>
i really do believe these are very useful for my personal improvement,<br>
but i think i've begun to take generalized negative criticism into consideration, which is a no no <sub>🐇</sub><br>
for example, when people generally talk negative things about humans, girls, anything that applies to me, i keep evaluating my behavior to see if i'm doing these bad things too<br>
the problem is that even when i realize that i am not doing anything bad, at all, and that the comment was true but generalized, i still feel sad because the image of who i am is at first bad, right ?<br>
i think it's important for my maturation to realize that people's opinions can really be very negative about me at first, but if they are not true, i should not be worrying about it. it only hurts me.<br>
it's natural to people who generalize opinions and stereotype things and people, and if these are bad things, i naturally have to overcome them by myself, and not try to "clean the image" of all people, if after all, they are not doing their best too.<br>
i think this is an important lesson !!<br>
<br>
do you also evaluate your behavior frequently ?<br>
being the best that i can makes me very happy, but it's tiring when i'm being too strict with myself <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
i will focus on giving my best to give pride to those who know me.<br>
it's hard to think a lot, but i feel very lucky to be a person and be able to have my heart connected with those i love & with nature <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font><br>

there are only songs that are really special to me and that bring me sweet memories !<br>
consider it as my present for you <sub>🌹</sub><br>
<br>
i would like to comment that i have received some line stickers recently, from bubu, and i love them !!<br>
i especially like my "alice in wonderland" ones, because i really always identified myself in some way with alice .. from the book, but from some inspired media as well.<br>
i especially identify with the feeling of dissociation, lack of reality and irritability that she shows in the course of the story.<br>
i think my life was very marked by that, and it was a way for me to be able to understand who i really am and to deal with the world around me, while understanding what fantasies are and their power over reality !<br>
( okay, i may be going a little far.. but you got the point )<br>
anyway, here are the alice line stickers i mentioned :<br>

i feel absolutely soft these days ~<br>
i have learned a lot about patience and self control, but mostly about self care !<br>
i'm pretty anxious when it comes to being productive, i'd say i'm almost addicted to that sense of accomplishment after having a busy day.<br>
the problem is that i always felt useless when i was in my spare time ; ;<br>
this is not healthy, so i'm trying my best to respect the free hours of my day as much as the working hours, after all, both are important <sub>🛏</sub><br>
i'm also feeling that i'm getting more and more free of the "physical" things... even though they really matter to me, i know that too much bonding to them emotionally makes me feel needy easily, which is not good at all !<br>
it is definitely essential to remember that the most important things are not physical, because naturally, what makes us feel like home is where our heart is, not our body <sub>💝</sub><br>
<br>
now i would like to show you a very round & extremely adorable little bunny that i felted :<br>

such a cute aesthetic, i adore it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
today, i'll write about some virtual world issues !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
as you know, i am very involved with the "virtual world". the internet is part of my life and many of my works are digital. even so, i highly value the caution in creating a "virtual identity" just as i think it's sorely primordial to avoid spending too much time on the internet and overvalue the virtual world.<br>
i learned over time that the virtual world may seem "perfect" and incredible, just as it very easily occupies our time ( often not free time ) and entertains us ; but it's also very limited, so it is not worth replacing your "real life" time.<br>
the internet can be very useful for learning new things, interacting with people from all over the world, personal improving, and even for sorts of important jobs and hobbies, which is why i love the internet and value it. but the internet can only stimulate our sight and hearing, and we have five senses. only real life can stimulate all five senses and bring us full life experiences full of sensations and feelings !!<br>
you can't eat freshly picked wild berries, you can't feel the scent of flowers, you can't pet a fluffy animal, you can't hug people you love over the internet. don't substitute your real time for the virtual, it's not worth it. the internet has many limitations, it is inferior in comparison.<br>
and just as all experiences are much more intense and wonderful in real life, you too can only be as perfect and better as possible in real life. the virtual identity that we create exists to allow us to introduce others who are far from us, we can put together the best visuals we can offer and we can also publish works and receive reviews and feedback, we can learn and improve ; but you really are much more special with all the details. your image and voice are not all you have to offer, you in real life are a complete person and if you focus on improving yourself as a whole and not only superficially, you can enjoy the virtual world and the world real in the best way possible : beneficial, fun and above all, healthy ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
these are subjects that i always see people having confused feelings about, and that also confused me a lot for several years ; ;<br>
it's the kind of thing that gets in the way of our personal development, so i really hope that my texts are useful to you in some way <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>💕</sub><br>
i have great news for you : i decided that i will learn how to sew clothes, like my mom !!<br>
yes, i really want to improve my seamstress skills now.<br>
i decided this when thinking about the topic of fashion and how i love designing my own clothes.. and i don't really know how to sew clothes.<br>
i don't want to depend on my mom forever to sew my clothes and put ideas into practice, so i've decided that i will learn seriously !<br>
i'll start with simple clothes for myself, but as soon as i become more confident i want to sew more complex clothing <sub>👚👜</sub><br>
so you will see cute clothes and purses here in the near future <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
i'm really excited for this, i know it will be a big improvement for me <sub>🌷</sub><br>
my mom is encouraging me a lot and will teach me all the techniques !<br>
it's time to overcome the apprehension with sewing machines... wish me luck <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
well, for showing today, i have here a colorful, nostalgic and super cute collage !!<br>

<br>
nooow, of course, double q&a !<br>
i wrote very positive and motivating texts this time, the first one is about a positive world view, the second one is about self care.<br>
i wonder if these motivational texts actually help in any way and are not just "temporary positive energy"<br>
i struggle to follow my own advice, if you want to know... it's easy to cry a lot and get mad at everything and everyone <sub>🌧</sub><br>
but the important thing is to take a deep breath and think before you act not to hurt yourself or other people !<br>
things will not be always easy or positive, right ?<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅰ<br>
i want to urgently vent on this, it's so tiring to see people being bitter and negative, i just wanted to say : the world is not ugly.<br>
the world is not a bad place, people are not horrible, life is not sad and tragic, no no no !!!<br>
to begin with, the world is simply neutral. nature works in an extremely balanced way, everything is always in its proper place + bad and good things are equally necessary for everything to work well. it's impossible for a world to be good if only good things exist, i know it's confusing, but good and evil only exist if both exist. and this is something positive !<br>
good experiences are better after bad moments of perseverance to achieve them. dreams are only dreams because they can't be realized right away. the fact that there are bad things and difficulties should be something that motivates you and makes the world interesting and beautiful, not the other way around ; ;<br>
moreover, beauty is something very abstract in general. the world is not really ugly or beautiful, it's neutral because beauty depends on the eyes of the beholder. for example, you may very much like to eat a dish that looks disgusting but has a divine flavor. the "beauty" as we know is something visual, not that it's wrong, since i myself am an extremely visual person and always use this love for beauty to find out more about myself and the world, beautiful things make me feel happy and motivated, i love beauty ; but this is not so important in the world in general.<br>
our sight is something sensitive and if you miss it, it's not as if all the beauty is gone. even if beauty is mostly visual, there is a lot more involved in this concept than we should consider as well. good things are always present in our lives : smells, tastes, sounds, textures... all this is as important as the visual. the beauty is in all this, so it is impossible not to have beauty in all things, no matter how "ugly" it may seem.<br>
the world, life, nature, being perfectly neutral, allow us to take our paths and interpret things as we wish. i consider it healthy enough to be positive and see the usefulness and necessity of bad things as a motivational and educational way, and see good things as blessings to be enjoyed to the fullest, cherished and treasured as nostalgias. i consider the world a perfectly beautiful place because i want to be happy. like, why would i see the bad side of everything on purpose ? this doesn't make sense to me.<br>
my desire is to mature enough to be happy and find beauty and importance in all sorts of things. it's not just a romanticization, it's a way of being able to enjoy life in a healthy and light way, to stay bright and pure no matter what bad experiences you have experienced.<br>
the world is neutral but i consider it the most beautiful thing possible because it is purely perfect exactly as it is. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
to complete this subject, i think people are also very negative when they talk about their bodies... and i'm not even talking about visual insecurities about it, but people really underestimate their bodies. our physical body is not just a bunch of flesh and by chance we're stuck inside it, it makes me sad when people talk like that, it's so disrespectful ; ;<br>
our physical body is much more than just where we live, it's an organism. our organism. and even being ours, we control almost nothing about it, have you ever thought of it ? our body digests food all by itself, our body absorbs the vitamins from sunlight all by itself, our body keeps the temperature stable by all by itself, our body heals bruises all by itself !!! this is so wonderful, our body does everything possible to keep us healthy, not just physically, but emotionally as well. our body even offers endorphins to make us feel rewarded when we have good attitudes and everything ( and these genuinely make us happy ). even if you have a terminal illness, your body will never give up trying to heal you, it will try to keep you as healthy as possible until the last second ! i know it's all instinctive and natural, not really an act of voluntary goodness ; but it's still positive, isn't it ? <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i honestly feel my heart ache when i see people treating their bodies badly... our bodies are so good to us. yes, it fails sometimes, i myself have several skin allergies and for a long time blamed my body for it. my skin is too sensitive and has exaggerated and bad reactions to deal with things it doesn't approve of, but my skin is not conscious. it doesn't know that it's exaggerating, but it still does a great job and keeps me generally very healthy, so it would be unfair not to like it just because it's too sensitive <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
besides our body always doing its best to keep us safe, healthy and satisfied, it is an important part of nature. our body is much larger than we think, there are infinite other tiny living beings that live in our body! our body is not only good for us as it is for other living beings, and it protects all this "small" ecosystem of living things that is harmful and damages our balance.<br>
it is very important that we take care of our physical body in the best possible way : eat properly, use your muscles, get enough sleep, drink water.. whatever you can do, because it is not only a container for your soul, but a part of nature. being organic can have disadvantages, but being part of nature and being such a complex organism is definitely very rewarding and an experience that we should value !!! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
i've seen a lot of "self care" content lately, which is pretty good, but some of them are a very confusing or materialistic. i support all sorts of naturally healthy and satisfying tips for our relaxation and well-being ; but some tips are simply toxic, for they force us to do things and be in situations that might do us more harm than good ; ;<br>
i've been feeling kinda sad over the last few days because i've discovered some bad things about people i had not noticed before.. i'm very happy, i'm satisfied with my life, i enjoy every day to the fullest and i try to observe the details and enjoy my time. i have routines and rules to follow that i consider healthy and i feel happy to follow because they bring me good things. i always try to be authentic and sincere, i don't like to pretend or seek approval from other people, i don't do anything that doesn't bring me joy and satisfaction. i give my best to help others in everything i can, and above all, to be happy. and i am happy. i have several life goals, but i'm happy at the moment too, because i live completely and honestly. i believe that i take good care of myself, since i feel happy, right ?<br>
but i realized that people who are following standards for their lives, who are not honest with themselves, who seek happiness just in the future, in objects, in appearance, in relationships... people who are not happy, they can't accept that some people can be happy. truly happy. i realized that some people think i'm "weird" and antisocial, maybe even depressive, because i don't have a very active social life, because i don't maintain relationships with people who are toxic, because i don't force myself to do things that make me sad. i felt sad about it because i realized that it is impossible to "prove" to people that i really am happy and that i could even try to help them to be happier, too. they just don't believe me. they just keep "caring" about me and trying to help me ( ????? )<br>
so after reading about these attitudes i was able to learn something crucial about self care : do nothing that is not comfortable for you.<br>
i know that sometimes we need to make efforts to achieve our goals, but don't push yourself beyond the limit. if something you do is sincerely making you sad and making your life bad, don't do it.<br>
it's hard because people are going to think bad things about you, especially if for being happy you need to isolate yourself a bit socially. i'm a very introverted person so for me it is sincerely very uncomfortable being in some situations, and i don't put myself into them, i refuse. i'm honest and i just hope people will respect me, but people don't respect that kind of choice because they think we have to constantly fight against ourselves to fit patterns and thus be happy.<br>
a good example : your dream of full happiness is to live on a farm completely isolated from society. you accomplish this dream and you are more fully happy than you have ever been before !! people should be happy for you, right ? in fact, they will always tend to feel sorry for you and think that you are isolating yourself, depressingly. this is because they can't imagine themselves in the same situation as you as something good, it's not like they're being purposely inconvenient, they just don't understand. and that's why some self care tips are not always good or work for everyone ; everyone's happiness is found in different ways. we must respect this !<br>
you will never be happy if you force yourself to do things that make you sad, if you keep on seeking incessantly for happiness, molding yourself to be the "rich", "healthy", "successful", "beautiful", "friendly" people think you need to be ; this is not how life works. there's no way you can fit into all these molds, it's an unobtainable ideal. being happy and taking good care of yourself is much simpler than it seems, it just involves being yourself and doing what you love <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
fill your life with things that make you smile, that make you feel healthy and full. fill your life and your mind with your purity, your essence, you can be happy just being full. that is perfection. there is no better self care than being happy now and with what you have : you will be a much better, secure, kinder, wiser person ; you will be better for yourself and for others !!!<br>
i know it may seem a bit vague, but it's just that : don't take self care tips "for your own good", even if it comes from people you love, if those tips don't make you happy. it's just not good or right.<br>
<br><br>
that's it for today !! take care <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍰</sub><br>
yes, so many posts in a short time !!<br>
this is because i have a lot of content to post here, and more and more... so i have planned several posts yet for this year !<br>
i have learned a lot about plants, it has become a great interest <sub>🌱</sub><br>
i've always been very interested in animals, but i think plants are also great, i just.. really like to take care of other living things, in general.<br>
i feel really good helping who i can, i want to take care of many plants and animals, the best as i can <sub>🍄</sub><br>
<br>
i have organized many things here these days, old things.<br>
this has left me pretty nostalgic, so i decided to start some projects to "eternalize" my memories !<br>
i have several letter paper and notebook pages that i kind of collected when i was in school, so i decided to cover a box with my favorite papers and use it to keep my journals. i've had diaries since i was 8, so they're very precious to me <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
the box got a 2000s aesthetic with many different shades of pink and glitter.. which is nostalgically perfect, even if not very aesthetically neat, you know ?<br>
thinking about it, i remembered the digital stuff that i did at the time, that follow this same idea ! <sub>🍓</sub><br>
i have here folders with very old things, from when i started to use the internet, including several .txt files with posts that i posted on my old blog, all the images i used ( i always kept everything for security )<br>
and, i also have all the layouts i've done + the codes !!<br>
i would really like to eternalize my first blog..<br>
so i recreated my first blog, from 2004, with the codes and images and texts i had saved, with a post from 2006, and it's all exactly as it was before <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
i used a cute domain ( 2006.pooftie.me ), because it really fits the whole thing ~<br>
( probably i will remake this page in the future though, since the layout is a little broken at the moment, after all it was made for the old internet explorer )<br>

i used to embed youtube videos on the blog for music, so that's what i did. i didn't have the exact music i was using at the time, but i remember it was from di gi charat, so that's what i have put there !<br>
i liked to use english words sometimes, but i didn't really know any english at the time, so mostly everything is in portuguese.<br>
if you know portuguese, you will be surprised with my correct grammar ( since i was 8 ), and it's true, i had the help of my mom to write things right on my blog ! i was a little perfectionist ..<br>
of course my mom always knew what i posted on my blog, so she helped me a lot. it was a very important time for me, i was learning many new things and i read and write a lot <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
i think the internet can be very productive for children, if they use it in a healthy way.<br>
i have many good memories of my old blog, i'm very happy that now it really is properly eternalized !<br>
<br>
today i'm going to post another needle felt cutie here, a shy little lamb <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

people who have an interest in web design often have questions about how i made this site, and all my other websites. as you all know, i've made things in html for many years, and i start making lots of random projects all the time. html and css are something i love wholeheartedly ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i made this site, just like all my stuff in html, from scratch. i write everything in notepad and test in .html files, or in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://test.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">my html tester</font></a>.<br>
i know there are several platforms nowadays, but i always did everything from scratch because it was how i decided to start with html. from the beginning i always thought : if i had total freedom to put everything exactly where i want and as i wish ; it was perfect. it was what i wanted. dealing with platforms for web design has always irritated me a little, honestly, since they are all focused on boring commercial websites and leave no room for creativity ; ;<br>
<br>
so, i don't have "website builder" platforms to recommend, since dealing with pure html codes is my preferred way of doing things. if you really want to do things beautifully and freely, you have to lose the fear of dealing with pure codes.<br><br>
<b>edit //</b> now i have a free base project with tutorials that you can use to get started with learning basic html & css for layout arrangements : <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://base.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">base.pooftie.me</font></a>
<br><br>
if you'd like to add dynamic content to your website, i know coding them will be hard ( and you will also need server connection, which is complicated and expensive ) so using a platform that offers widgets that you can insert into your static codes is an easy solution !<br>
<br>
when working on image-based layouts web design is much more about graphic design and aesthetics rather than coding, so it's important that you are prepared to deal with lots of image editing. i really recommend you have folders of materials and graphics that can be useful - save everything you like, and can use. i have had several folders of materials since i was a kid, and i got all that content basically exploring the internet !<br>
if you'd like inspiration for web design, you can download thematic material packs on my <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://aes.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">aesthetic virtual journal</font></a> website.<br>
there are plenty of sites with free cute graphics that you can use for your website, and those are called "sozai", and i have one myself. please feel free to download everything : <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://sozai.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">sozai.pooftie.me</font></a>
<br><br>
the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://web.archive.org" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">wayback machine</font></a> is also wonderful to find interesting sites that no longer are active. i have the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://middlepot.com/recommended" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">recommended page</font></a> where i always update with some sites & blog that are really inspiring as well.<br><br>

now that you have plenty of materials for making beautiful things, you must deal with codes. i find html very easy, i started learning it when i was 8, simply with small tutorials and mainly browsing other people's blogs. i know it may seem controversial but when it comes to html there is a lot that you can ( and should ) take reference to other people's codes because these are things that everyone can use and are not owned by someone specific.<br>
i honestly recommend that you always look at the source code of all the sites you are interested in understanding how they were made. after a little study you will understand how things work and will learn mostly from this practice. make sure you have a folder for codes ( you can just save it in txt files ) because you will always find things that are interesting and that you may want to use in the future !<br>
when it comes to css and javascript ( style and script ) you can find some code that is original and can not be copied, but in this case you will certainly see a warning text. if you see no warning, you are free to try to use !<br>
<br>
to practice, i recommend doing small projects like some pictures and texts on the screen, cute little random things that you have in mind .. just let the imagination flow, think of things you'd like to do with the codes you've saved. if you really want to do layouts for a website or blog, i recommend starting with a base code. remember : my <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://base.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">base project</font></a> is completely free to use !<br>
in fact, to be clear, <b>i allow</b> you to always look at the source code of my websites if you need inspiration or understand how i did things in it. you can use all the scripts and css, too. just don't copy everything ( especially visually ), of course, be original !<br>
<br>
it's very bad copying the whole source code from someone's site to use as a base, so make sure to be careful about it, and search for base layouts that are okay to copy from, and edit from them.<br>
decide what you want to do exactly, then look for codes for that sort of thing, so you can add more to your site over time. you can find whole codes that are visually neutral for you to modify, or you can find only parts of what you want. you can put it all together smoothly. if you are using specific platforms, you will need base code to do what you want functionally within the platform, since these have rules of use and operation !<br>
<br>
after some time and experience you can make a base code for yourself. add cute signatures and some codes that you specifically like in them. i have websites where you can copy some <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://ascii.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">cute symbols</font></a> as well as <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://utf8.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">unicode font</font></a>s, so you can organize your codes and make the cutest ascii art signatures !<br>
i have a base code myself, i always use some similar css and i have a pretty cute ascii art signature at the beginning and end of all html pages.<br>
<br>
in the beginning, you may feel a little bit of tension in messing with the base code and ruining everything, but over time you will feel more comfortable. i took a lot of time to do things freely, remembering that i did my first layout at the age of 8, so although i managed to do pretty good things, i obviously had a long time to get to where i am today <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
it's normal that you don't understand anything that's going on for a long time, but don't worry about it, because the important thing is that things are working. you will understand how everything works with practice. now, when it comes to javascript, the thing really complicates. it is much more like actual "programming" than html and css, so you'll have to study harder if you want to make interesting scripts by yourself ; but you don't have to worry about it at the beginning, if programming is not of your interest, because you can find some free scripts that do all sorts of things. it is still possible to make great things only with your interest in the visual side of web design ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
good, now that you already have your inspirations, your materials & graphics folder, your useful codes folder, your base codes .. where to post your projects and studies ?<br>
there are several sites where you can post things in html, but i recommend neocities and github ( the one i use ). there you can also host your website without the need for paying for a dedicated server !<br>
on github you can upload plenty of different static websites using one account, by making a repository for each project you have and putting the .html files there, you can change the domains separately and everything.
<br><br>
talking on domains, both neocities and github offer free subdomains, but there are other sites where you can get cute subdomains for free !<br>
for having actual domains you have to buy them, but i used to get some free subdomains at <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://freedns.afraid.org" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">freedns</font></a> ( just be careful to choose only public domains ).<br>
be careful though : i only recommend using the most popular domains from the first page, some of them have security problems so please be careful .. it's always safer to buy your own domain !<br>
to get ssl on your html pages, remember that all the links you have in your code must be "https", including images and scripts. thus, you will be able to get ssl easily on any platform you are using ! finding good websites ( with ssl ) to host your stuff to use in your codes can be difficult and time-consuming, but i have on the <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://middlepot.com/credits" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">credits page</font></a> all the sites i use to host each file type ! i recommend each of them, until the present moment.<br>
<br>
i think that's all !! everything that i indicated here are things that i legitimately do and that work for me.<br>
seeing ideas starting to become reality is sure to be the biggest motivation for you, so please don't give up before you try !!<br>
i hope from the bottom of my heart that i could help and inspire you somehow <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

　<sub>📍</sub> ⅱ<br>
so, to begin with, i would like to say that beauty is directly linked to good things about people. a kind person is certainly very beautiful, and i've talked about it before... but in a more visual way, i believe that the healthier and natural you look, the more beautiful, visually. if you keep artificial and unhealthy, it will be hard to feel comfortable in your body, and that is an important attribute for beauty. people who are just running away from their natural beauty have hard times with self-esteem, and that's sad.<br>
i would like to help, so i'll give you beauty tips on what i value : health and comfort !<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> skin care :<br>
i have very sensitive skin, i have allergies frequently. this condition always makes me worry about the products i use. i always use natural products or baby products, these don't give me allergy and luckily are also great, i don't think i should be using any other type of product !<br>
i think it is essential to keep the skin clean, hydrated and free of harsh chemicals. i always wash the skin with natural ( or baby ) soaps, which are very soft and don't take too much natural oil from the skin. my skin is not very oily so i worry about keeping the natural oils and using them to my advantage. i've never had problems with acne or blackheads, but i've always had whiteheads, what have helped me more than anything about them and also keeps my skin completely clean of any pollution are two things : honey and rose milk !<br>
honey is truly amazing, the skin becomes incredibly soft, clean, with an incredible natural glow and it also helps a lot in recovering from any damage, since it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. i use honey on my skin frequently, i also use it + sugar to exfoliate from time to time. i always use in bruises and when my skin is having allergic reactions to avoid bigger problems and help in healthy recovery.<br>
rose milk is basically rose water + baking soda and some other things, which make the rose water become milky in texture and color. this mixture cleans a lot from any pollution, it's amazing and i use it whenever i feel i need.<br>
to moisturize my body skin i always use natural oils or baby oil. i apply by massaging on the whole body, especially in areas with more fat, because this helps blood circulation and the skin gets more elasticity. my favorite oils for the body are coconut oil and almond oil. they are also great natural deodorants, and i think the combination of the two smells like vanilla, which is lovely !<br>
to moisturize my face i prefer to use rice cream, as it feels lighter and has lots of benefits & vitamins. when cleaning my face sometimes i use oils ( i like using rosehip oil ), but i always wash them away with water afterwards for avoiding clogged pores.<br>
despite my skin care routine ( with cleansing, exfoliation & hydration ) is only once a day, it's important to keep the skin clean and moisturized all day. during the winter my skin gets very dry, so i'm always moisturizing it, multiple times a day. during the summer my skin can look greasy, especially if i'm outside, so i always clean my face and hands with baby wipes for delicate skin ( washing only with fresh water is most appropriate, but not always possible ) and use moisturizer. keeping the skin fresh is very important to avoid pollution and premature aging !<br>
i can also recommend you to always wash your face with fresh water ( cold water is best so your pores won't be left open ), wear sunscreen every day ( i prefer to use formulas for kids or natural ones with coconut oil ), since the sun is important and it is good to sunbathe in the morning, but the afternoon sun can be terribly bad for your skin .. and of course : drink lots of water ( two liters a day is the minimum ), this is really important !!<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> hair care :<br>
because of the sensitivity of my skin, i also use natural products or baby products in my hair, of course. since my hair is completely natural i don't need to worry so much about it, i use few products. my hair is very wavy and long ( hip length ). it is also not too oily, just like my skin, so i also like to take advantage of the natural oils. i usually wash it three times a week in hot weather and twice in cold weather, i only use water and baby shampoo normally. no conditioner. why did i mention the water ? because it is very important, even if you haven't thought about it, it's part of the cleaning process as well. i always wash my hair with plenty of water and rub well the root to spread the natural oils to the tips, only after that i apply a bit of shampoo on the roots to clean the excess oil, sweat and pollution. i feel that this process makes my hair much lighter and it gets very clean, soft and hydrated !<br>
i always dry the roots of my hair with a cold blow drier, i put my hair upside down and run my fingers to help in the process. i only use hair brushes or combs when my hair is completely dry, and it really really helps to avoid breakage !<br>
i like using wide wooden combs, they keep the hair very soft and hydrated up to the tips, plus they don't cause hair loss or frizz. to keep your hair always looking healthy it's very important to brush it multiple times a day, slowly & gently, especially if you went outside because the wind and pollution gives it a greasy look.<br>
for extra hydration i always use natural oils, the same ones i use for my skin. i apply them in my hands first, in small amounts, then i gently tap my hair. i usually do that when my hair is dry, but if needed i apply some extra oil on the tips a few hours before washing it too.<br>
i never use tight elastics in my hair, i avoid any hairstyles that cause breakage ( or headaches ), and from time to time i look for and trim split ends with sharp scissors. i always cut my hair myself !<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> makeup :<br>
um i almost don't wear makeup, i don't think i have much experience to talk about it, but i certainly do have my preferences, so i'll share them with you.<br>
i don't like to wear makeup most of the time because i am very "aware" of it in my skin, and it feels weird .. so i mostly use it when i'm in the mood for dressing up, and i always keep it very light. wearing light makeup helps my skin stay healthy, anyway. it doesn't like many products.<br>
i don't like wearing foundation, i just use a light concealer to cover my dark cirles a little bit. i'm used to it though, so i don't go for a 100% coverage and just let it be.<br>
in my eyes i often wear eyelash curler and brown mascara. i prefer the very thin brushes, since they help me achieve the most natural look !<br>
i don't do much with my eyebrows, since i don't really bother with them all natural, but sometimes i use a small trimmer and brown pencil for filling just a little tiny bit.<br>
i don't like bronzer, but i really love blush, a lot, especially cream brush ! i also like highlighter, but i use it wisely ( i try ). i always get inspired in igari makeup and i struggle not to use too much blush and look like sunburned ; ;<br>
on my lips i always moisturize constantly with natural oils ( my lips get dry often i hate it ), but i am truly an eternal lover of lip gloss and lip balm. i don't like lipsticks, though. i like to have my lips super moisturized and shiny, but not very colored.<br>
umm and sometimes i add a little tiny bit of white glitter on my cheeks, lips or eyelids ! i think it's very cute.<br>
for sealing the makeup, if i'm outside for long periods of time, i like using a tiny bit of moisturizing translucent powder. it looks natural, and also feels more comfortable on my skin.<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> nails :<br>
i'm also not very experienced with nail art, but i'll talk about my nails anyway.. !<br>
i think there are not many secrets to getting your nails healthy, i think proper nutrition and hydration are the most important thing. my nails grow very fast, just like my hair, i can't really tell the reasons because it was always like this.. but i can say i always keep them super moisturized with natural oils ( the same ones i use for the skin ), i do so multiple times a day using a cuticle pen, whenever i wash my hands, besides regular hand creams.<br>
it's very important to also keep your nails clean and moisturized when outside, so i never forget to carry some baby wipes and moisturizer !<br>
i always cut the cuticles ( not too much, just the excess ) to keep things clean, and avoid picking on them when i'm bored. i prefer to file my natural nails short & oval shape, and i like to wear a thin coat of clear gel polish, just to keep them shiny & cute at all times.<br>
<b>edit //</b> i recently got into nail art again after many years, but now i'm only doing it on fake nails, so i can easily glue them on & off when i'm in the mood for dressing up. way more comfortable !<br>
i file them a little longer than my natural nails & almond shape, and i like to paint them with "jelly" gel polish, making gradients of soft pinks, whites or creams .. sometimes i apply a bit of glitter, or glue little things on them, like ribbons or hearts.<br>
<br>
　　<sub>💓</sub> tl ; dr :<br>
if you always stay clean, moisturized and hydrated you will always be healthy and flawless from the beginning until the end of the day, which will definitely make your life a lot better !!<br>
i don't think it's really necessary to spend lots of time & money to achieve good results. i found over time that using light, natural products, while embracing more my natural appearance work the best .. it feels more like self care.<br>
<br><br>
i'm very sincere in these texts, really based on personal experiences.<br>
i always try my best to be clear and useful to you,<br>
so please tell me your opinions <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

i'm having lots of ideas for projects, but it's hard to organize time for all things ..<br>
i'm planning new things for the store, i'm sooooo happy with the progress !!!<br>
things are definitely exceeding my expectations <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i'll not tell you my plans for now, since i still have to try hard to make it happen the way i want it <sub>🌕</sub><br>
i just have to thank you a lot for the messages and the affection i receive, it makes me always motivated to do my best <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
<br>
this post will be a little long, so i'll start right away with the things i did last week !<br>
i'll start with this beautiful collage, which i was planning to do for some time :<br>

it's truly an ethereal aesthetic, don't you think ?<br>
i believe that no one is better than her to represent it <sub>🤍</sub><br>
it was a great experience for me to deal with so different color tones together !<br>
i feel like i usually run away from dark colors on almost anything, but they also represent a part of who i am, it's important that i practice more how to use them within my aesthetic !<br>
<br>
here's the melody i used, i think it matched perfectly :<br>

with kinda the same aesthetic, i made a page in html that is very simple, but it is somehow very important for me.<br>
of course, with matching url ( soft.pooftie.me )<br>
i've always wanted to do something like this in html, but it's strangely time-consuming, even though it looks so simple <sub>🪑</sub><br>

<br><br>
people have always had a problem with female stereotypes. there is pressure on the girls to be always cute, feminine and delicate. i totally disapprove of people trying to shape the personality of people for the purpose of making them "ideal" within stereotypes. both girls and boys should not change their personality with the intention of feeling "fit" in society, since this behavior causes sadness, confusion, problems and unhealthy relationships.<br>
in the search of freedom of aesthetics and mannerisms people began to always treat these feminine adjectives as if they were something inferior and undesirable. i have read countless times about how "being cute and delicate is desirable in society because they want women to be weak and controllable", and no, that's not a correct way to talk about it !!!<br>
the cuteness, delicacy and elegance are feminine characteristics, and just like the masculine characteristics, are tendencies but not facts. a girl may have more masculine characteristics, and vice versa ; there is nothing wrong with that. in nature the feminine and the masculine work together and form all that exists of good ( and bad ), it's the balance of things. the personality of people is complex, so of course you should not change who you are because of others ; but wanting to reject your natural feminine qualities because you somehow think that male qualities are better, is a very serious problem. it is actually offensive to the female image.<br>
makes me deeply sad as people speak as if being soft and delicate is a sign of weakness and inferiority when there is no connexion between these things. to say that being feminine is a bad thing and that we must fight not to appear feminine and delicate for not to be treated in a bad way is so extremely wrong !!<br>
girls and boys in nature have strength, endurance and power equally, only represented in different ways. matriarchal and patriarchal societies are focused on these forces : motherhood & paternity. these are the most natural and pure in both, both take care of each other as family, both have different but equally important roles. the problem is that patriarchal society often makes it seem that the male strenght is desirable and important, that physical strength, dominance, and logical reasoning are the best, that emotional intelligence, kindness, and wisdom are weak. this is not true, because there is not one better than the other.<br>
in fact, the female image is also very associated with beauty. this obviously doesn't mean that girls should be beautiful, but this type of beauty is associated with health and youth, since it is something that is naturally bright and wonderful related to fertility. in this way, while healthy, pure and natural, feminine beauty is something that we all naturally appreciate a lot and i think it should not be treated as objectification ; the real objectification is the plastic and artificial way the girls force themselves to be to have social approval.<br>
so yes, if your personality have cuteness and femininity, it doesn't mean that you are inferior or childish. you should not be ashamed of it or try to become more masculine, just because others think you should. you must above all embrace your natural qualities and your personality traits as your strength and importance in society exist anyway and are great. being feminine doesn't mean you can't have control over your life and your actions !<br>
just remember that you deserve to be happy and respected, you are strong and lovely no matter how feminine or masculine you are, you can - and should - be purely yourself <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
i hope this helps some people !!<br>

modesty aside, i'm really in love with the layout i made <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
i'm so very happy to have decided to make a layout of my own. before i was not going to do it and i was going to use a platform, i thought it would make things easier ...<br>
but i definitely think it's important that my store is as cute as possible and i'd like to do my best for that !!!<br>
i the domain is pretty nice as well : shybunny.store<br>
i am finally officializing the poofties brand and starting my own business. so exciting !!<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🐇</sub><br>
aaa i'm so excited !!!<br>
i'm finally ready to start my online store, shy bunny <sub>💕</sub><br>
i took pictures of all the items and i will post them in the next days !<br>
i'm going to do disclosure on my accounts, which has similar aesthetics, and i also plan to make a giveaway.<br>
i'm organizing everything the best i can <sub>👜</sub><br>
<br>
well, i plan to post lots of cute crafts from now on !!<br>
i'm very happy about this, since it is something as important to me as my digital works.<br>
lately i've been pretty excited about trying different aesthetics for decoration, i'm always saving new material and i get inspired easily !<br>
i always have real strong tendencies for decorating everything with my main aesthetic ( because it always warms my heart right away ), but i believe my secondary aesthetics also represent important parts of who i am. <sub>🎗</sub><br>
i think they deserve some love too <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
i'm having lots of fun trying new color combinations, different textures... i feel that i'm improving a lot.<br>
today i'm going to show you a very nice chubby teddy bear, that will be in the store :<br>

i just feel like squeezing him and giving him lots of kisses ..<br>
<br>
i would also like to post here a simple drawing that i colored.<br>
it's really nothing special, i was just bored, but i think it's cute and nostalgic <sub>☂️</sub><br>

<br><br>
do you also think painting is relaxing ?<br>
i absolutely love digital coloring <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
in this post i have an important thing to talk with you :<br>
why i am slowly giving up social media because of numbers !<br>
( yes, a lot of text lately, i hope it's not a problem ; ; )<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
social media have created this need for big numbers in people and i feel that i don't have reasons to keep seeing numbers than to praise a false reputation for my image on the internet. i'm just a normal person doing my best, just like any other person. i reflected a lot on this and people treating me differently because of numbers is not something that i value and i don't think is good for me or the visitors. the race for numbers and fame is not the kind of thing i'd be proud to encourage on my site ( or anywhere else, but unfortunately that's not always an option, hence why i avoid social media so much ).<br>
i used to keep numbers exposed despite not approving their overvaluation because i believed it could bring public ; maybe people could took me more seriously if i had big numbers ? maybe they could allow themselves to look at the site more easily if they saw this "seal of approval" from previous visitors ?<br>
... but is it really worth blinding people with such superficial information and then saying it's not important ?<br>
i have come to the conclusion that i must be an example and show that appreciation of numbers is not healthy or productive.<br>
i felt free from this race for numbers as i started moving away from social media, and i discovered over time that frequent visitors of my site are not here either by the numbers, but by the content, just as they are on other interesting sites and blogs of the internet. it definitely warms my heart to know that my work honestly attracts so many people <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
it's extremely invigorating to be free of ego needs and social fears.<br>
hiding numbers and keeping written feedback is more productive for everyone. i wish from the bottom of my heart that people would exchange more real interaction, not in the form of numbers, but words and actions.<br>
i'm little by little getting more and more clean of the "numbers", and it's making me feel really good and refreshed.. !<br>
now i'm trying to get rid of all of my social media with big follower numbers. yes, i did my best there, i spent time and effort posting content, but now it's time to refresh things.<br>
i was just really tired of all of this.. random strangers following me just because of a random viral post, creeps messaging me, my accs turning to feel important and platforms treating it like nothing.. so stressful !!<br>
i writed my reasons, and i honestly think these changes are an improvement for me and the quality of my content <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
even if not using social media for posting personal content, it's still the best way to reach people and make friends. this is what i wanted, from the begin, and just now i'm being able to actually reach people's hearts !<br>
the thing is,, my accs with lots of random people and artificial interactions were consuming my patience and time and i couldn't actually interact with others because it wasn't even safe to try approaching them ; i want to have more time for healthy relationships and for myself.<br>
on my own websites i am more spontaneous and helpful to others, i can make friends and approach people safely, i am able to interact with my friends and be there for everyone who needs me, i can support people i admire and i want it to be soft !! i want my life to be softer, in general.<br>
i'm happy to say that this is becoming reality <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
i'm ironically being able to reach a higher number of people now than before, not with just cute stuff but my feelings too, and i believe it's because i'm doing better and being more sincere. i now can say i truly care about every single people that interact with my posts, because i can actually enter their accs and see they're trying their best too !!<br>
my large accounts always had infinitely less interactions than the number of followers, which means that obviously many of those accounts were inactive or people who didn't even care about who they're following. i don't want it anymore. i want real people, a comfortable and safe ambient for me and everyone ! the internet can be a place full of illusions. i believe the numbers are one of the most dangerous illusions.<br>
i feel lighthearted now, as i'm being able to communicate with others better and doing what i wanted from the begin : reaching your hearts and soften your feelings !<br>
i feel softer now.. i'm happy life made me see how artificial and unnecessary all these numbers are. i learned that real people are important ; kind and lovely people, who will be there. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
and i will be there, too ! even with the distance, i am here.<br>
<br>
i hope i can inspire you to improve your internet life, too..<br>
is it really healthy and safe for you, right now ?<br>
<br>
<br>
i wish you all the joy and solace !!!<br>
<br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>💖</sub><br>
aaa i have good news, and some updates !!<br>
i got a new camera, i'm so excited, i already took some beautiful pictures <sub>📷</sub><br>
i used to take pictures with my old phone or my mom's camera, which is good, but it was not always possible, so it kept me from taking pictures of some specific things like some of my crafts and.. well, myself.<br>
because of that, my pictures were usually inconsistent quality and it bothered me a lot ; ;<br>
i felt insecure and confused about posting my pics so many were randomly posted on my tumblr blogs <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
so now, i decided to organize my folders and just kept the beautiful, good quality pics. i deleted a lot of old stuff and even updated the look book page, the "about" pic and the portfolio.<br>
i decided to just make one session for my pictures in the look book and make them temporary ( i usually get tired of looking at old photos at some point so i know they will be deleted sometime ).<br>
this session will be for pictures of myself in general, because i don't really take pics of my looks or my face often, but more "specific" pics. i never knew where to post these here, so now i have a place.<br>
some old pics will be reposted from time to time, so i will not specify dates !<br>
i still don't think i'll post selfies often anyway, and i'll keep taking pictures with pajamas and nightgowns, because as i've said before, it's how i usually feel comfortable.<br>
i still have lots of updates to do about it + i'll post my crafts more often, so stay tuned <sub>📱</sub><br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i also deleted most of my inactive accounts.<br>
i hope these changes haven't been uncomfortable for anyone, i just like to keep things organized <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<br>
so, today's post will be small ..<br>
but i will be back soon, okay ? take care of yourselves !<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>👶</sub><br>
i realize how this website has grown since its creation and i am very proud of the progress <sub>🐑</sub><br>
i'm doing my best to bring frequent updates and useful content to you !!<br>
please ask me complex questions to write about, it's hard to think about subjects that seem relevant..<br>
i get many questions that would not really do a good q&a, you know ?<br>
<br>
you know that i have a routine page, i have schedules to do certain things and daily tasks, this helps me a lot to organize things, as well as my weekly listings and schedules.<br>
of course life doesn't always collaborate and we have to make adaptations, but it is great to have a base to know what to do and not waste time.<br>
so, i've been trying hard to spend less time on the internet lately !<br>
if i'm forced to do this i always find a way to do everything in a short time, but it is difficult to have discipline when i have free time ; ;<br>
some of my tasks require the internet, so i defined a period of 3 hours a day as the maaaaximum time on the internet, on those more complicated days ; but i usually spend 2 hours or even 1 hour and i'm very happy about it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>
it's a very important practice, especially for those who do many "quiet" activities like me, it is necessary to space these times to stretch, drink water, make snacks and take some air outside.<br>
in fact, i would like to clarify that i don't really wake up 6 am going to sleep 1 am, it would be torture.. <sub>🛏</sub><br>
i just get up to watch the sunrise ( when it's possible, i really like doing it ), so i also eat a fruit and plan my day ; if it's very hot i like to take a shower to refresh, then i go back to sleep until 10 am !<br>
i just really wake up at 6 am if i need to and in that case i always go to bed before midnight.<br>
<br>
i was writing lots of letters lately and thinking.. sometimes i get a little annoyed with my handwriting because it's very... childish <sub>🍮</sub><br>
i don't know how to explain, i don't think it's ugly, it's kinda cute ; but it's a little clumsy, small and "roundy", it's the same handwriting that i see in my old school notebooks !!<br>
if you have already exchanged letters with me or have already seen my handwriting fonts you will understand.<br>
( by the way, if you are interested in exchanging letters don't hesitate to contact me in the email because i love doing this <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> )<br>
i really like calligraphy so i train a lot, i like to write in different letters to make decorated titles and "aesthetic" texts, but my natural handwriting really is childish and there's nothing i can do about it ; ;<br>
they say people's handwriting reflects their personality, i know everyone has a unique handwriting that is a "brand" of them and that's very special <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
but it is impossible not to envy people who have naturally mature and elegant handwriting <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
well, i can "simulate" this if i really want to, but it's not the same since it inevitably doesn't suit me very much so i usually just prefer to be myself.<br>
<br>
enough of talking, today the post will have a super cute drawing that i colored <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !<br>

<br>
today's q&a is something sweet and positive for you <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

<br><br>
have you ever seen people who are so beautiful, kind and have a lovely aura that makes everyone feel comfortable and safe around ? it seems like a rare and precious personality trait, like this person knows nothing bad and lives in a beautiful and different reality.<br>
in fact, i have learned over time that this is a skill to be acquired with maturity. bad experiences don't influence who you really are and shouldn't make you have a heavy and sad aura. bad experiences happen for you to mature and to be able to avoid them in the future, as well as helping other people in a similar situation ; traumas are not part of you, all bad things you've been through, you've seen or just know that exist, none of that is part of you and none of that represents your reality.<br>
you should never become ignorant, keep yourself informed of the world situation and mold your opinions is very important to live healthy and safe ! however, it is extremely important to keep yourself pure despite all this. purity will give you a different aura and will make your reality, in fact, beautiful.<br>
don't let bad thoughts and memories affect you continuously ; boring and ugly things are a part of life and you really should deal with them properly and don't ignore them, but you should not make them a personal problem. on daily basis you should forget everything bad and only think of beautiful and pleasant things that you live, lived and would like to live : daydream, watch the sky, pick flowers, write love letters, wear perfume, put on pajamas all day, wear your favorite dress casually ! life has many opportunities for you to make it beautiful and create good memories for you to keep and share with others.<br>
surround yourself with beautiful things, embellish ugly things you don't like to look at, cherish people who love you & move away from people who are toxic to you. small details in your life can greatly help shaping your ability to be positive and emanate kindness and beauty <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
remember : the kinder you are, the more beautiful you become ( and that includes being kind to yourself )<br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>🧸</sub><br>
this is a very special month, since it's the 1 year anniversary of middlepot.com<br>
+ i turn 21 years old <sub>💘</sub><br>
i wish i could express in words how much i love this place and how i love to post here !!<br>
it was definitely the best thing i've done to date and i plan to make it better and better for me and you fluffies,<br>
so don't hesitate to send me your opinions and tips <sub>🍪</sub><br>
<br>
the days are going very smoothly and i just baked marshmallows, so i'm a comfy girl ..<br>
i hope everything stays this way until saturday, which is my birthday, because i'll go on a date with my beloved bubu and i want it to be perfect <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font><br>
<br>
this post will be full of soft and cozy things, all in a similar aesthetic that i've been wanting to work with for some time, i recommend you eat something sweet to get into it <sub>🧇</sub><br>
to start, i've made a new page for the aesthetic book !<br>
it's so fun to make these collages, i really want to do it often, if you support me <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

i think this activity is very good for practicing dealing with aesthetics other than my main one, and as i've been aiming to improve my "beautifying" skills i'm doing my best to try different things while maintaining my individuality.<br>
do you think i'm doing well ?<br>

it's soft and friendly, just like a teddy bear, so i think it fits well <sub>☕️</sub><br>
<br>
and talking about teddy bears, i had a sudden idea when i saw my png folder and realized that i had a lot of stuffed animals in there ( 56 specifically )<br>
i had to do something with them urgently, they can't just be homeless and all over the place ..<br>
so i started to make a html page that was comfortable to store them, organizing my virtual stuffie collection !!!<br>

<br>
today i want to write some important tips to you who often feel dissociated and confused with your very existence.<br>
it is a very complicated subject, but i know what i'm going to say here is a good introduction to reflections and learning that you will have to follow on your own ; getting started is usually difficult so i'll say the method i chose to better understand myself, my passions and goals.<br>
will i really be able to help someone with these words .. ?<br>
i wish from the bottom of my heart !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i know that the pursuit of self-knowledge is something that never ends, but i, being a young adult, realize that young people usually seek to be special in some way, seeking individuality. the thing is that we are all different and have individualities already.<br>
if you don't know your individuality you can't enjoy life so much, you can't be yourself and improve, so you just become artificial and sad.. if you just let it go, it makes you more and more faded over time.<br>
feeling dissociated and not knowing who you are is a bad feeling and should not be taken to life, so i will share how i managed to understand who i really am and my individuality, in hopes that it can help some of you !<br>
something that helps me a lot to understand who i am are aesthetics. i know this term may seem rather silly and superficial, but you can call it many other things too : style, spectrum, tendency, essence .. i like to call it aesthetics because i am quite a visual person, but you must understand that what i mean by that is simply the essence of who you are, represented through visuals, personality, lifestyle, passions and others.<br>
<br>
we are very stimulated seeing beautiful things everywhere, aesthetics that we want for ourselves. the problem is that we can not be all things, although we have different moods and personal tastes, there are limits to who we can be ; when you go beyond these limits you feel dissociated and uncomfortable.<br>
only you can know who you really are and recognize when you're not being yourself, so you must first learn to understand your feelings and not be carried away by the desires of being someone different. people are beautiful and feel happy in different ways ( and only when they are being themselves ) .<br>
you certainly have personal tastes and should not suppress them to fit into groups. those personal tastes help you a lot to understand your personal essence ( since we don't really can choose to like things voluntarily, right ? ) .<br>
i discovered who i am separating my personal tastes : whenever i had to choose a color, a music, a food, a place, above all others, although i like lots of different things, i often had a specific preference - there was a clear pattern in these things, despite different moods.<br>
in this way, through experimentation, i was able to discover my favorite aesthetic ( but not the only one i embrace ) .<br>
i must say : you will not find yours coming from someone else, but you will find elements that will compose your personal aesthetic all over the place. aesthetics carry specific messages and feelings, so you must understand what you are looking for, what fills your heart with a comforting feeling, what feels like home to you.<br>
<br>
it may seem confusing, but for example : i've always liked cute, delicate, and feminine things ; within that there may be infinite variations, so i sometimes felt confused and uncomfortable with some cute things that did not really match me. "but i like cute stuff, what's the problem ??" i thought.<br>
the problem is that i am me, i am a person, and people are complex. i began to realize that i felt artificial when trying to adhere some elements that didn't represent me ( because despite being visually alike, carried different feelings ) .<br>
gradually i separated the elements and composed some aesthetics that i really liked and i felt comfortable about it, until i discovered my ult fav one !<br>
but even so, i also have lots of interests that don't "match" my favorite aesthetic in any way, shape or form - but this is also me. i embrace this too, and don't avoid it. i am who i am. if i'm comfortable with myself and shape my surroundings to reflect my interests, i feel happy. that's what i look forward : purity.<br>
for "aesthetic reasons" you may not see me showing around all of that at once ( because i don't necessarily find all of that very cute ) , but i still enjoy those things during my day and don't push myself away from them, you know ?<br>
in resume : being spontaneous is important, but doesn't mean you should make a mess out of it, if you are the organized type of person. some things fit into a single style that you make for yourself, others don't .. but you're not supposed to "wear" and "show off" everything you like anyway !<br>
<br>
a tip for you to get started : think about the adjectives that define things. these adjectives should complement and make sense to you, should be pleasant and make you feel good ( even the negative ones ) . you must do this with all things, not just with visuals, since your essence is present in all the things that make up you.<br>
by understanding who you are, it will be much easier to find your comfort spaces and self improve. you will be able to have healthier relationships and inspire other people, you will have better self esteem, since you will better understand your personality and individual beauty ( and therefore take better care of yourself as you will also understand your limits ) , you will be able to find hobbies that please you, to find out what you want to do with your life, you will be happier and will continue to be free to enjoy things that "don't fit" your main aesthetic, since this is also part of your individuality and should not be denied.<br>
you will find purity, and within that, your true happiness !<br>
i would like to make it clear that when thinking about things, you should think about your individual opinions on them rather than what others feel about them. focus on how you want to feel, instead of what you want to be perceived for.<br>
only you can know yourself deeply and truthfully. people will naturally see you as you are, so just be yourself and make the best out of it !<br>
<br><br>
i hope my words are useful <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍮</sub><br>
i've been feeling so in love these days <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
whenever i am i send endless messages of love and appreciation to everyone i admire, in addition to writing lots of poems and love letters to bubu ( my favorite person in the whole world, of course he deserves it )<br>
and in return i always get very heartwaming messages that make me blush <sub>💟</sub><br>
if you feel like spreading love, always do it !<br>
don't keep compliments just for yourself, let who you love know how much you love them<br>
( if you're shy, do it anonymously, but always do it )<br>
<br>
um, today i want to tell you that i found a new comfort character <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

it's winter here, but every afternoon is comfortably warm and sunny, really motivating <sub>🌱</sub><br>
i would like to also thank everyone who has sent me very beautiful messages <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🍦</sub><br>
many new things are coming soon !!<br>
as you may know, some of my projects have been standing for some time because of some important things i've been doing lately. i'm actually quite busy with these things, but i've been reflecting on all my projects and realized that i should not let them totally stand still for so long. they all exist for a reason and keeping them active would help me a lot to practice my skills in different areas, after all they were created to motivate me to study and always be using my creativity ! also, they have a story behind, i care for them.<br>
i always value my hobbies because they make me happy, even if i know i'm not so talented at everything i do, i think it's worth doing my best to keep doing it. i will continue updating all my projects even if it is with a lower frequency ; being occupied with other things is not a justification to abandon them !<br>
i'm feeling pretty motivated so i'm certainly updating all my projects.<br>
<br>
so, maybe you have seen that i posted a new html stuff..<br>
 an aesthetic virtual journal <sub>📚</sub><br>
i had this idea randomly when i was doing collage. i love doing this and i always have several journals with different aesthetics, stationery is one of my big passions ! i also like to put pieces of fabric, ribbons, buttons, even beautiful packaging.<br>
i've always wanted to somehow do this digitally, but i have never really tried, until now. it's actually easy, and a lot of fun <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
i took the opportunity to offer you some cute thematic materials that you can use for decoration, digitally or even printed. not all the stuff that i offer in these packs are mine, these are just things that i have saved here, so if anyone doesn't want their content to be included please let me know <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
i intend to keep making new pages, so stay tuned <sub>💻</sub><br>
the domain is cute ( aes.pooftie.me ) and i'll leave a backup file for every page i make :<br>

have you noticed, over there ? that's right, ssl !!<br>
i know this is kinda silly, but i was actually thinking about getting "https" on my website for a while.<br>
it took some time, but i did it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!<br>
( and also with all the other web pages )<br>
<br>
i'd like to talk a little bit about my projects that are a little stuck,,<br>
the shy bunny store, of course. i just had financial problems these times ; ;<br>
things are normalizing and i'm saving money again to start the shop and for all my future plans. i'm working hard the best i can !<br>
it will be super comfy and cute, i have so many ideas for decoration and everything. i know that i will be able to realize this dream, even if it takes time, i will do my best for the future !! i always feel so happy to work with things that are beautiful and make people feel happy, it's literally the best thing in the world for me.<br>
life is a surprise pot and we should never stop dreaming about what will come out of it <sub>❤️</sub><br>
<br>
recently i've gone back to drawing some little things.. maybe i'll use them on next games ? you'll see..<br>
i also have here a little music box that i hope will warm your heart :<br>

<br>
well for this post i also have a q&a !<br>
i want to stop writing many personal topics in a row.. but it's fine, this is my personal blog after all.<br>
this is just out of curiosity : a text about my name !<br>
<br><br>

<br>
melissa is my name in real life. i really like my name, but i don't use it a lot on the internet because it's common, so it would be difficult to find me. melissa is the name of a plant, the lemon balm. the meaning of melissa is "honeybee", because its flowers are rich in nectar, so it is sometimes planted to feed bees.<br>
its little white flowers, sometimes with a yellowish or pinkish tinge, bloom throughout the summer ( fun fact : i was born in august ! )<br>
my friends and family sometimes call me "mel" , which means literally honey.
<br>
<br>
　<sub>🖇</sub> <font color="#91816b">𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑡</font>
<br>
this is actually a surname, and i use it as "artistic signature" on my works. it is not a real surname, i discovered it in a dream by the time i was still concepting the "poofties" project. one day i dreamed about a giant white cat made of milk, who called me "melissa middlepot".<br>
i visualize it as : a melissa flower twig inside a pot, in the middle of a window sill.<br>
i love this delicate concept, so i accepted it wholeheartedly !
<br>
<br>
　<sub>🖇</sub> <font color="#91816b">𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑖𝑒</font>
<br>
well, pooftie is not an actual name, but the way all the critters from the "poofti world" are called ( so, me included ! )<br>
it is a fictional word that comes from "pooft" : one onomatopoeia for the muffled sound of something falling on the ground. all the species that inhabit poofti first arrived falling from the sky, so this is a way of remembering that they are equals, and should do their best to care of each other and work together for a happier future.<br>
yes, that's why my brand is called "poofties" !
<br>
<br>
　<sub>🖇</sub> <font color="#91816b">𝑝𝑢𝑓</font>
<br>
puf is actually a character from the poofti world. it's who i am, there !<br>
middlepot is the surname that was given for me by the milky cat, but my "pooftie self" is called puf - it's a nickname that comes from creampuff.<br>
puf is a "softie", a metamorphic critter that can take the form of anything that is "soft" enough. she is often seen in the form of a teddy bear, bunny, lamb, kitten, puppy, or even a human girl - sometimes with wings, but she cannot fly.<br>
i like to use her name and variations a lot ! small and cute.<br><br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this hasn't been too boring to read ..<br>

hiii fluffies <sub>🐇</sub><br>
where do you live, is it getting hot or cold ?<br>
here is a super nice climate, a gentle cold, soft sunlight + the rains have stopped completely. it's my favorite weather season !!<br>
for those who remember the past post, my trip with bubu was magical, i would like to travel with him all the time <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font><br>
it's not usual for me to travel, i sometimes spend years without leaving nearby. i want to travel a lot in the future <sub>🦋</sub><br>
<br>
i made a new playlist recently, for asmr / comfort. i've been thinking about making it for some time, since i usually watch a lot of asmr channels that are not very well known and many videos that i like are asmr not intentional. you will find all kind of stimmy and aesthetically pleasing videos !<br>
most videos are from japanese and korean channels, but some videos are in english and portuguese.<br>
i hope this playlist will help you relax and discover new content !!<br>
maybe you can even learn to make some recipes <sub>🍰</sub><br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>❤️</sub><br>
i would like to thank once again the support you give me, it is really very special for me !!<br>
the ideas you give me are very useful and i never tire of saying thank you <sub>💐</sub><br>
because of my routine post yesterday i received some messages thanking the inspiration for organization and productivity, but i also received some rather sad messages saying that they couldn't be productive or follow schedules like me.<br>
i would like to clarify that although schedules are important, it is not always possible to follow them.<br>
sometimes i go to sleep later than i intended, sometimes i wake up with a headache, i don't force myself to go beyond my limits <sub>🛏</sub><br>
everyone has different limits, you don't have to do multiple tasks every day, you don't have to wake up at 6:30 am, it's different for every person !<br>
your routine should be tailored to your lifestyle and your chores and hobbies should be things that you feel good doing, and i didn't include household chores in the routine because they vary according to need,,<br>
but i have these as well, every day <sub>🎁</sub><br>
it's important to be productive but it's also important to stay healthy and happy, never forget !<br>
<br>
soooooo, i'm super happy these days because tomorrow, day 5, me and bubu have completed 5 years of dating <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!!!<br>
we're going to take a little trip together and i'm super extremely excited and i dream about it every day !!<br>
i love him so so so so so much <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font><br>
<br>
so,, because of yesterday's very personal post with information about my personality, some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it.<br>
i'll add these in the /faq page :<br><br>
<b>edit //</b> this list has been constantly updated through the years !<br>
<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my height is 168cm ( 5'6 )<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my current weight is 50kg ( 110 lbs )<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my foot size is 23cm ( 9 in )<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my hair is currently hip length ( and i am keeping it )<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my hair changes colors a bit according to the lighting, it becomes lighter if i go out in the sun frequently. it's light brown / dark blonde, and sometimes it gets a few orangy & blonde highlights, that are noticeable in the sunlight<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs. i find it cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs !<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my mom used to cut my hair, and now i cut it myself ( i'm not very good at it, but my hair is quite wavy so you can't notice small mistakes )<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　my eye color is cyan / turquoise + a little bit grayish<br>
<sub>🖇</sub>　.. i'm a-cup <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
<br>
... of course i would not leave the post with just that, it would be a bit shameful.<br>
i have something much more important to post on today's q&a, super very extremely important :<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub>💌</sub> <font style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #f7ebe8;">q & a</font> <sub>✏️</sub></center>
<br><br>
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
<br>
i really hope it touched your heart !<br>
<br>

aaaa <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font> i'm so thankful for the cute messages i've received lately !!<br>
you all are so kind to me, i don't deserve it ..<br>
also, i love it when you send me suggestions. i like to post things you want to see !<br>
<br>
um, so, do you remember that i was training to be ambidextrous ?<br>
i think i can consider that i already got there !!<br>
i really can't believe how fast that was, i thought it would take a long time <sub>🖋</sub><br>
i am training every day using my left hand to do day-to-day tasks, and to write.<br>
i'd say i can do things 80% the same way with my left hand now !<br>
and i can write with the same handwriting, but it's a bit slower ( i never can write too fast anyway )<br>
well, i am very proud of the progress <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> !!<br>
<br>
today the post will be a little more personal, since you have been asking for some little things <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
these days i was writing down my routine, as usual. i usually write down daily task lists, but i always had some items that i repeated every day.<br>
for ease, i wrote down these items in a txt, which i kept for a while. it was not very cute, so i thought i should write it somewhere else ...<br>
i was in the mood to do some pretty cute html page, so i did one with some things from my routine !!<br>
it was quite spontaneous, i was not even going to show it to anyone at first.<br>
but as you asked for some more personal things like that, and it was so cute, i decided to post !<br>
and with a super cute url ( day.pooftie.me ), of course <sub>💻</sub><br>
i will leave here a backup file, as always :<br>

it's in portuguese because.. well, i'm actually going to use it on a day-to-day basis and like i said, it was written spontaneously.<br>
i hope you don't mind ; ;<br>
<br>
so, because of the other post where i say that i don't like people to "guess" my personality through tests, astrology, blood type or anything, you asked me to post things about my personality.<br>
i'm actually quite honored that you really care about me that way, it's very sweet <sub>💗</sub><br>

<sub>🎗</sub>　i think too much about everything, so i try to practice gratitude instead of feeling melancholic about things ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i deeply value purity. for me purity is directly linked to your true personality, who you really are. i never forget who i am and what i believed and wanted from myself when i was a child and i want more than anything to be proud of myself, both the adult me and the child me from the past.<br>

<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　my sense of humor is quite childish, so i laugh at really silly things ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i cry a lot, sad and happy ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　my main interest is beautiful things and to make things beautiful ;<br>
<sub>🎗</sub>　i like everything that warms my heart and i try to fill my life with these things ;<br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>🤍</sub><br>
hmpf, i've been super anxious these days, which has decreased my productivity <sub>🌧</sub><br>
i'm trying hard to keep on doing my tasks, persistence is very important !!<br>
i always feel like a very good girl when i finish doing what i have to do <sub>🎗</sub><br>
( don't worry, i'm having enough rest, or i'd be overwhelmed, right ? )<br>
<br>
day 8 is bubu's birthday !!! <sub>🍰</sub><br>
i'm obviously going to make surprises for him and prepare something very special. i'm so excited !!<br>
<br>
i'm going to show you today some of the first things i've embroidered, my favorite ones :<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
i think it turned out really cute and good images to use as graphics !<br>
i've been embroidering a lot lately, but these are the first ones i did, so it's more special.<br>
<br>
take some time today to take care of yourselves, okay ?<br>
i shall be going for today, but i will be back soon ..<br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>☂️</sub><br>
the rain doesn't stop, day in day out .. it's starting to get boring, honestly.<br>
i'm reading a lot about gardening these days <sub>🌷</sub><br>
i've had a lot of trouble because the super humid weather of the season is making them bad ; ;<br>
if you have any suggestions, i would appreciate it !!<br>
<br>
so, this is a little random, but i want to share it with you ,,<br>
since i was little i always wanted to be ambidextrous, because it seems to be an incredible and useful ability !<br>
i've always been too lazy to start practicing, but now i'm really training my left hand ( i'm right-handed ), and it has not been that hard.<br>
writing is, as expected, the hardest part <sub>🖋</sub><br>
taking advantage of my interest in calligraphy, i'm training every day and it's been a lot of fun, i'm improving fast !!<br>
i feel even sorry for having underestimated my left hand all this time <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font><br>
( oh i also have trained my sleep, sleeping and waking up every day at the same time. it was always hard for me, but bubu is encouraging me and i'm doing very well ! )<br>
by the way, have you seen the new fonts i made, with my handwriting ?<br>
i really really liked the result, even if they have some spacing problems .. i think it's still ok !<br>
you can download it on my portfolio, and use anywhere you like <sub>💖</sub><br>
<br>
this post is a little small, but i have lots for the next ones..<br>
see you soon ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>

hiii fluffies <sub>💓</sub><br>
i would like to thank you for the latest messages, i'm very happy to answer each one of them <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font><br>
your suggestions and opinions are always very important to me.<br>
it's truly unbelievable that this site actually has been visited almost 15 million times !!!<br>
<br>
it's rainy season here and bubu bought me a new cute umbrella <sub>🌧</sub><br>
.. i love bubu so much, he makes me so happy, i can't help myself, i have to tell everyone !!!<br>
these days i have worked hard to learn how to cook and bake, i really feel like making delicious things in our future house <sub>🏠</sub><br>
<br>
umm i have something super very special that i found and despite having exited a lot to post here because i am extremely shy with my voice, i think it's worth it, because i worked hard !<br>
that's from a couple of years ago, when i was part of a small cover group with some friends. i had a very bad microphone, so i got a new one and recorded some songs and my friend edited.<br>
i'm very shy, so i didn't show to many people besides them and it ended up getting lost in time. luckily, i backed up this specific song, my fav one. i decided to post here today :<br>
<br>
<br><br>

<center><sub>🩰</sub> <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://file.pooftie.me/a/secret%20base.mp3" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">secret base .mp3</a></center>
</font></font></font>
<br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br>
i don't have the microphone anymore, but i'd like to buy another. i don't think i'd record more songs because it's really hard for me, but maybe i could talk to you fluffies ?<br>
i think it might be a good idea, please give me suggestions !!<br>
<br>
so, i'm not going to do a q&a today, sorry ; ;<br>
but i have something stuck in my throat and i really need to vent :<br>
<br>
please : <b>stop spreading hate</b> !!!!!!<br>
i've seen a lot of people all over internet spreading hate to feel better about their problems, and hate is NEVER the solution !<br>
hating people will not help you or make you a better person, it's immature and very very bad !<br>
writing about solutions, about what you think it's bad and must be helped ( almost everything can be helped if you try your best ) is important, but hating people is just not right !<br>
how do you expect things to get better by making other people hate you because you hate them !?<br>
nature is sure to teach you to value the really important things in life, and you can be sure that it is not internet drama.<br>
please, be kinder <sub>🩹</sub><br>

hiiii fluffies <sub>🐁</sub><br>
today's post will be short, but i hope you enjoy it anyway !<br>
i'm a lil bit sleepy but i'll try hard to write everything right <sub>🍄</sub><br>
i think i never told you but i like to make a lot of papercrafts and paper houses, i also have a wooden house that i want to paint and decorate ..<br>
do you like to make paper things too ? it's a great hobby of mine !<br>
i'm thinking of starting 3D modeling, so i can make cute papercrafts for you to download.. but modeling is so hard ; ;<br>
<br>
umm, today i wanted to show you some comfort characters of mine, that i identify a lot with !<br>
people are doing lots of these "id" lists recently, so i thought it would be fun :<br>

i'm melting completely .. summer makes me so uncomfortable ;;<br>
it has been raining a lot, too. it's not the kind of nice rain you can get out with cute umbrellas and have fun, i'm talking about very scary thunderstorms !! <sub>☂️</sub><br>
i wish the summer were not so extreme here ...<br>
it's difficult to do anything in this climate, but i colored some little things that i'll show here today :<br>

hiiiii fluffies <sub>💘</sub><br>
2018 !!!<br>
i really really hope this year to be full of hope, achievement and love for you all !!<br>
you have made me so happy since i made this website, i have just felt joy in updating it and bringing new things to you. thank you soooo much !<br>
the new years is always a complicated time to do things, so i have nothing really new to show here today .. sorry <sub>🌱</sub><br>
but, i would like to make a small but very very important request today :<br>
<br><br>
please spread love, be kind to each other !!!<br>
you don't know how important it is and how it makes a difference on a person's day to receive a loving message.<br>
even if it's in anonymous, be sure to tell people you admire how much you love them, how special and incredible they are !! <sub>🐈</sub><br>
i promise you'll never regret doing it and it will feel great !<br>
spread love on the internet, spread love with letters and secret messages, spread words of love in every way you can !<br>
<br>
sooo, today i have some things i want to clarify about my current accounts :<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i can't do personal posts on social media because it would be extremely uncomfortable for me, so i just post personal stuff here on my own websites !!<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i'm sorry, but i really can't share promos or do games ( again, i just don't want my accounts to be personal ) but it really warms my heart when people tag me in all kind of cute stuff. please send me everything you think i would like on my email ( letters@middlepot.com ) , so i can check it properly !<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i can't pay attention to every single interaction because i'm not really active, but i try my best to only interact with people i trust to avoid any stress or drama.<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> you are free to unfollow me, softblock or just hardblock me at any time. i don't take those things personally at all, and just want you to be comfortable.<br>
<br>
<sub>📍</sub> i always always read links, byf & dni, and respect people's boundaries deeply. if i ever make a mistake, please let me know !<br>
<br><br>
and that's it ! i hope what i said is of some use to you..<br>
i love you all so so so much !!! <sub>💗</sub><br>
thank you for being here for me !<br>
<br>
xoxo <sub>🐌</sub><br>
