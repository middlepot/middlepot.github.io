hiii fluffies <sub>💘</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
here i am again, punctually, on the last day of the month ~
july was such a busy month, and i can't believe how many things i managed to do .. i have been making to do lists nonstop, and now i have stuff planned until january. oops !
i know i know, it's not possible to be sure of what will happen until then,, but i like to at least try and do a certain amount of stuff each month, if i'm feeling alright. if needed, i will simply rest and do only the very necessary <sub>🍰</sub>
lately i have been feeling quite healthy, which is great !!
i'm full of energy, and because of that i have been able to be very productive without pushing myself beyond my limits <sub>⭐</sub>

i have also been deep into nostalgia these days, because of all things i have worked on !
i think nostalgia is a huge part of who i am, i find so much joy when digging through stuff from the past .. so i'm happy to do things that allow me to express this, and share a bit of how i feel with others <sub>🌈</sub>
this is a very special time of the year for me because august is the month of my birthday, the <font color="#bfa8a8">middlepot.com</font> anniversary, and then september there is also the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> anniversary !!
i can’t believe i’ve been running this game for almost one year already .. 1 year old <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
and the <font color="#bfa8a8">middlepot.com</font> website itself is already going to become 5 years old, woa !
the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://poofties.club" target="_blank">poofties franchise</a> itself could also be considered 5 years old, maybe ??
it was officially released by 2017 too, but i was already developing the concepts & characters since 2013 ( the year i started dating bubu <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font> ) and released the first game by 2015, so mm.. i think it is way older than that.
i am pretty old myself, right ? i will turn 25 years by august 11 <sub>🎀</sub>
my only current project that is a bit of an outsider is the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank">shy bunny store</a>, that will turn 4 years old by november, but i renewed the layout last year by august as well LOL

it’s not even on purpose, but yea, this is a commemorative season for me, so i wanted to include concepts of that into the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> summer season by adding a new laptop shop called the "pool party store", and a cute upbeat music on the new mini game on the swimming pool area !
i’m going to show you, as always, some screenshots of the new stuff :</pre>

these are the summer activities : playing on the swimming pool with other fluffies ( there you get tanned, so don't forget to apply sunscreen ! ), working on the ice cream stand, playing juggling in the circus tent, and fishing on the serene forest lake !!
i especially like getting my little fluffy tanned, it's SO adorable <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>

this is the new laptop shop : bathing suits, floats and flowery accessories <sub>🌼</sub>
i really tried to go with 2000s casual summer fashion for this one, but then i mixed it with early 2010s as well !
the floats and sunglasses are super cute, i love them <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

making this shop, and the summer season in general, i got really inspired and nostalgic, so i made a <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://aes.pooftie.me/x" target="_blank">new collage</a> :</pre>

it's been so long since i made one of these for my <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://aes.pooftie.me" target="_blank">aesthetic virtual journal</a> .. i'm really proud of this one, i can't stop smiling when i look at it !!
really brings me back to 2005 <sub>🌈</sub>
i used to have many stationery with these cute colorful characters, and i was obsessed with water !!
i don't know how, but somehow i grew up being a little afraid of swimming ; ;
maybe that's because i don't spend so much time around pools anymore ?
i really want to get over it .. hmpf</pre><br>

this melody i found in one of my cds is really cheerful and fills my heart with happiness <sub>⭐</sub>
i liked saving music from game folders when i was little, so it is probably from one of my cds with 500 games in it .. i really want to find it !!


last week i also got in the mood for coloring, so i choosed a drawing from my <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://www.instagram.com/miki.takei" target="_blank">takei miki</a> coloring book :</pre>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
this time i simply used colored pencils, since takei miki's illustrations are usually colored this way ( and they are super pretty ) i wanted to achieve a similar result. what do you think ? <sub>✏️</sub>
i think it turned out really cute, and it was really relaxing to color spontaneously.. i want to color like this more often <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
most of all, it really inspired me for something i'm going to do on <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> !!

by mid september i want to make an anniversary event with lots of cute & colorful gifts, balloons, fireworks, and bonus teddycoins <sub>💕</sub>
( i won't spoiler you anymore, but it will have a similar feeling to the drawing )

i’m so happy to see that many people are still playing my game since it got released, and many more are registering accounts to this day !!!
being able to share this little world with you fluffies is a dream coming true, really, and i still have a hard time believing this is real ..
every new character, every message exchanged, every gift coupon generated - it is all unbelievably wonderful !
i would like to share a bit of this magical feeling with you, so i will do my best to make it a memorable event. <sub>⭐</sub>


before i forget, there is a bit more i have done for the game :</pre>

this new furniture have been inspired by some things i had as a kid !
the pink wallpaper with white hearts, the flower pillows, the pc chair.. many items there look similar to things i had, at least by memory.
because of that, this room decor feels really comforting to me <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
do you also feel comforted when seeing stuff that reminds you of fun childhood memories ?
it really has a deep meaning to me !



talking on nostalgia, do you fluffies remember when i was downloading ukagakas for my pc ?
i still have been keeping my favorite one, dorothy, open from time to time. she's just so cute and i like having her keeping me company <sub>🌷</sub>
i made a cute soft pink skin for her, and wanted to show you :</pre></font></font>

feel free to download it, as well as the balloon, which i also have modified to match her new clothes !
( i posted a download link of her regular skin by 2020, so you can get it on the blog's <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://middlepot.com/archive/2020" target="_blank">/archive</a> )




changing subjects, i wanted to let you know that i added something new to the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank">shy bunny store</a> checkout ( yes, again ) !
i got many requests over the time from people who couldn't buy the items in real life, for multiple reasons ( like not having a fixed shipping address, or having wool allergies ), but were still interested in having them digitally for integrating with the my fluffy life game, or simply for collecting.
i wasn't sure of how to make it work properly and fairly, but now here it is : a digital bag for you to purchase shy bunny items only digitally <sub>💻</sub></pre>
<br><br>

<center><a href="https://shybunny.store/bag" target="_blank"><img id="shybunnydigital" width="400px" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/icMdjnO.png"></a>

                if (++currentPosshybunnydigital >= imagesshybunnydigital.length)
                    currentPosshybunnydigital = 0;

                imageshybunnydigital.src = imagesshybunnydigital[currentPosshybunnydigital];
            }

            setInterval(volgendefotoshybunnydigital, 1000);

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
as you can see, there are some explanations on how it works on the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://shybunny.store/bag" target="_blank">/bag</a> page, when clicking the new button !
basically, you can add items normally to your bag, and they all appear on the digital bag as stuffies ( for cheaper than the real life ones would be )
when you purchase items this way, you get the codes by email ( as well as your extra gift coupons ) so you can add them to your <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://poofties.club/account" target="_blank">poofties account</a> virtual collection.
then, they get integrated with the poofties projects normally, appearing as stuffies and stickers !
i hope this will help those who couldn't buy items to also be able to enjoy these extra things <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">❤️</font>



lately i have been trying my best to fulfill requests that i get, and i have been asked about html quite a lot !!
knowing that people are getting more & more interested in making their own websites makes me so happy .. i want to be able to help others on their learning journey <sub>💝</sub>
i know how getting started from zero is hard, so i decided to make a new web page for providing a free base project with codes and some tutorials : <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://base.pooftie.me" target="_blank">base.pooftie.me</a></pre>
<br><br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i used to commission base layouts like this, upon request of what the person wanted to learn.
i tried to include the basics on this one, but i know you will feel the need to do more with time - but by then, hopefully, you will be confident enough to try out some things by yourself !!
starting slowly is important, from my experience <sub>🖇</sub>
i already saw some people using my codes out there, and it made me so so so happy.. to know i can help others to make their own sites <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">❤️</font>

by the way, there is another useful web page that i'm making for my august post, so keep an eye open !
what will it be about ? that's a secret <sub>🗝</sub>



some more things i have been doing this month : sewing purses <sub>👜</sub></pre>

this one is just a teddy head, it's super small - i honestly don't know how i will carry my things inside it LOL
but i mean, it's an adorable accessory, and i can always use it for just going for a walk nearby.
i'm absolutely in love with this outfit as a whole. it's comfortable, it's cute, it's frilly, it's perfect <sub>💟</sub>
i simply added lace to the blouse, but i made the skirt by myself. it may not look like it, but it's actually a divided skirt, which makes it extra comfortable !
it's obviously an outfit for hot days, so i will have to wait a bit for wearing it .. hopefully on my birthday it will be sunny enough <sub>🍦</sub></pre>

<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
this other purse is very simple, just a little fluffy square, so i added a satin ribbon and a little teddy bear charm i had laying around ( i always get these cuties in claw machines, and i'm very proud of that ) <sub>🧸</sub>
it has a reasonable size for actually, you know, carrying things inside, so i know it will be really useful !
this dress i bought is absolutely beautiful, it's long and the fabric isn't very cold so maybe this will be my birthday outfit instead ?
i think this look really matches my glasses, which is nice <sub>💗</sub>

did you know i have myopia ? mhm, since i was a teen, and i should wear glasses all the time, but i don't <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
it's not that bad so i spent many years with no glasses and got used to it, but i'm trying to slowly adapt, okay ? ; ;
i forget about it constantly, so i try to at least remember when i'm going outside and have to see stuff far away..

<sup>( fun fact : i made glasses exactly like mine for the my fluffy life game, but even there i don't wear them often )</sup>


i have been going through my photography folders and i found some pictures i took of my wardrobe, by 2020, and now looking at it i realized how much more things i have .. !
even though i actually got rid of many clothes that i didn't wear, i still got many more clothes over these 2 years. i think it's time to stop LOL
i took new photos of my wardrobe :</pre>

sadly that causes my clothes to be very wrinkly, so i always have to iron them ..

i mostly take photos of myself when i'm wearing these, because i only feel in the mood for it when i'm comfortable and bored at home.
can you recognize these from my <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://middlepot.com/fashion" target="_blank">/fashion</a> page photos ?<sub>📷</sub>

( you can see more about her and my other characters on my <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://middlepot.com/gaming" target="_blank">/gaming</a> page )
doesn't she look adorable ? i love this so so so much ..
i'm so thankful, arunyi is really talented and you all should go support her work right now !!

did you know that i choosed pupuf's looks thinking about "how the bunny puf would look like if she was a human" ?
her personality and interests also matches puf in "shy bunny form", heh <sub>🐇</sub>
she's really cute, this drawing made me want to play ragnarok again.. it's been so long since i logged in



well, this is what i have for today's post.
please remember to drink lots of water and wear sunscreen if it's summer where you live, and if it's winter too !! remember to stay hydrated & protect your skin all year long.
self care is always important, because you are important !

hiii fluffies <sub>❤️</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
how have you been ? i hope life has been kind to you ..
for me, many things happened, and my physical health haven't been in the best shape, but thankfully i have been feeling pretty happy !!
for making the most of the time i am not feeling sick i did some changes in my life, to make things as comfortable & productive as possible <sub>🎀</sub>
of course i couldn't be as productive as i would like, but i still managed to do some things i wanted to do, and keep myself focused on what i love, which is the most important !
i have loooots of things to write on this post.. so let's go :

if you're someone who visits my social media accounts, you might have noticed that i have been inactive for the past months.
that's because i have started working on the puf café planning phase, in the meantime i work on other things from my other projects ( whew )

since the puf cafe platform will be used for making websites and content for them, i need to work on many test pages, and different kinds of content for inside them, for later on developing tools based on what i used for making them <sub>💻</sub>
this is quite fun to do, to be honest, so i am enjoying my time !!
then, i realized i am actually producing lots of content that are way better quality than i am able to do on my social media accounts .. and i didn't miss posting on them, at all, not even once.
it's hard to explain the feeling : i knew that those sites were putting limitations on my creativity and making me feel discouraged, but i just accepted that for years. i thought i had no choice but to accept.
i want to put my heart into this project, so you fluffies will be able to experience this much freedom for posting & creating content, inside a safe space !
i am willing to invest all i can into that.


the big modern social media sites are unreliable, unorganized, and unsafe.
they undoubtedly have ill intended features for making people feel insecure, addicted, and stressed out.
they purposefully limit creativity, encourages shallow drama, and punish people for not following trends.
i am tired. i don't want that anymore.
i never wanted to be controlled by others like that. <sub>🌧</sub>

so, from now on : <b>my social media accounts will be officially inactive !</b>
i am officially unplugging myself out of the ugly world of the platforms runned by big companies. <sub>🌷</sub>
i will only use some private accounts for interacting with content i like, and that's it.

i never felt comfortable using my accounts in a personal way, for both my sanity & safety i've always kept things this way.
since 2012, when the old web as i knew was starting to collapse rapidly, i have been searching for a way to escape those uncomfortable spaces and find a way to express myself the way i want. <sub>🦋</sub>
many people feel the same as me, and are also trying to walk away from big social media, so i try to help myself and others by working on solutions !

after some months of use, <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://middlepot.com/faq#snippets" target="_blank">my web code snippets</a> have been a good help for making social media sites less stressful ( and cuter ) for me, but, as expected .. only as an inactive user.
i am still checking some youtube channels & tumblr blogs regularly, and it's actually nice !
( i received messages from people telling me that the codes helped them too, so i will keep them updated, there is no need to worry about that )

the thing is : whenever i try to create content inside them i feel restricted, unsafe, i see my work being reduced in quality, my creative potential being discarded .. and my imagination cannot flow naturally. <sub>✂️</sub>
the more i experience ways to freely create & share things with people on the internet, the more i want to make use of it, and bring that nice feeling to others through my projects !  


okay, but there are some hindrances that come with not using my accounts anymore :
where will i post self care content from now on ? how will i be able to update you fluffies about new stuff ? how will i be able to reach and get to know new people ?

i only feel 100% comfortable inside my own websites / games / platforms, or in those that belong to people i trust wholeheartedly.
i will work hard to make the puf café project come to reality as soon as possible, but we expect it to be fully released only by next year,,
so i have thought of some other alternatives, making use of what i have access to at the moment !


<sub>📍</sub> <sup>where will i post self care content from now on ?</sup>

i'm going to use the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://care.pooftie.me" target="_blank">care.pooftie.me</a> web page for posting all self care related content i'm making during tests !
since it was made for archiving my accounts' content, it seems appropriate to use it for similar content, don't you think ?
i revamped the layout completely and it is now "my safe room" where you can interact with objects to read stuff, listen to music, watch videos and have a full comforting experience <sub>🏠</sub></pre>
<br><br>

<center><a href="https://care.pooftie.me" target="_blank"><img width="400px" height="auto" src="https://imgur.com/KC0uzFJ.gif"></a>

</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i am super proud of this new layout, a virtual bedroom where i feel safe and comforted .. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
things are shuffled and appear randomly as you turn the lights on & off.
i will do my best to update it frequently, as i already have many ideas on what to add there !

now for the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://pooftie.me" target="_blank">pooftie.me</a> domain itself, which i was using until now for my tumblr blog, have turned into a new website and gateway to all my side web pages :</pre>
<br><br>

<center><a href="https://pooftie.me" target="_blank"><img width="400px" height="auto" src="https://imgur.com/0PUmSq2.gif"></a>

</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
at the moment the pooftie.me site has 17 subdomains, that are displayed randomly, and each one of them are represented by an object ( at the moment 18 objects, because one page is already under construction )
i think that this layout turned out really really cute, i'm happy <sub>💟</sub>
you can also expect this site being updated frequently !!

i will be making plenty of new web pages, for presenting you fluffies some concepts that will be possible to achieve on your own page using the puf café !
some things will be exclusive to the final project release, on the puf.cafe website ( yes, i already bought the domain ) such as chatting features, multiplayer interactivity, message boards .. things that require server connection <sub>💿</sub>
but the static website building stuff i'm working on will be used on my web pages, and i hope you fluffies will enjoy the new content <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>



<sub>📍</sub> <sup>how will i be able to update you fluffies about new stuff ?</sup>

i was thinking about it for a long time actually, because my blog is where i post all updates about my projects, my life, and everything .. but you don't get notified about them, and i don't necessarily post all the time, either.
also, i know my posts are reeeeally long, and not everyone has time and patience to read them .. !

so, i had an idea : making emails for the "poofties club monthly updates" <sub>🖇</sub>
everyone is free to register an account on the poofties site, and i can send an email once a month with the recent updates for each one of my projects, briefly written - and even attach little gifts, for maybe bringing some smiles <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
( i'm thinking about giving coupons, and some exclusive items for <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> )
oh, and no one will miss the gifts even if they choose not to receive emails, because you can also read the past months archive on the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://poofties.club/updates" target="_blank">poofties.club/updates</a> page ( non-existent as i write this post, but tomorrow there will be the june updates )

to inform about this new thing, i will send one email asking if you'd like to receive the monthly updates or not, with a sample attached. if ignoring it you won't receive any other updates, and if confirming, it will be easy to cancel them through the account settings, or the email itself.
i think this is a gentle way to remind every fluffy about the new stuff that are being released, without being annoying with spammy notifications or stuff like that. what do you think ?



<sub>📍</sub> <sup>how will i be able to reach and get to know new people ?</sup>

well, i have been using forums, message boards, chat boxes, online games and many other kinds of small social platforms since ever, and i will continue to do so !
it's just that from now on, i will have a preference for places that make me feel safe, runned by people i trust, so i can prioritize my well-beign.
i actually think that big platforms tend to make it harder than usual to both find small creators, and to reach a niche audience for your content .. which is really a shame !
my content, aesthetics and interestes are super specific, so i don't feel welcomed on big communities at all. <sub>☂️</sub>

the standard way for me to find new cool stuff and get to know people is to explore the internet for blogs, personal websites, forums and group chats in general.
that is the way i feel most comfortable, and where i got to know most of my friends too <sub>💗</sub>
because i am already used to the "old web" format of internet ( that's how everything started for me ) , i don't think it's truly hard to socialize, find new interests or even advertise content without the use of big social media.

during the 2010s things went downhill and almost everyone was obsessed with social media, because it was still something new and cool, but since the 2020s began i can see a clearly change on people's perspective.
i am not the only person leaving big social media, i know many others who did / are doing / are willing to do the same, and because of the growing popularity of "webcore" aesthetics, 2000s fashion and the neocities platform, many people are making blogs and personal websites for themselves, which i feel super happy & excited about !!! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i am really hopeful for the future of the internet, and i will embrace this completely and do my best to help by making my own projects, and sharing those of people i admire. <sub>🎗</sub>
please visit my /recommended page, as it is frequently updated with new wonderful sites !!

to encourage people to share my projects with others and reach more people, i made widgets for showing my fluffy life profiles and characters, that can be added on blogs & websites !
these are mine :</pre>

if you are seeing these right now, it means i just got 2 teddycoins, one per view ! isn't that cool ?
and, if you share any kind of post talking about the game ( such as a screenshot, or simply a link to the site ) on your blog, accounts, anywhere really, you can send the screenshot of the post to me and be compensated with teddycoins as well :</pre>

we got good results with this approach, many new people got to know the game since then, and i haven't myself advertised it during this time i was away from social media.
i can't ( and don't want to ) be everywhere for advertising my stuff, so it's true that the community itself can help a lot, and i am very very thankful for that <sub>⭐</sub>

after that, i also did sharing rewards for the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank">shy bunny store</a>, by making widgets for showing felted fluffy collections !
these are my stuffies and cards :</pre>

since i live in brazil, i know that using paypal can be a big hassle, and converting the currency is also complicated .. so i finally managed to add a new option !
if you're from brazil you can now pay with credit card, pix, boleto, and have a discount ( because it's a national transaction, after all ) so i have updated all the prices accordingly.



now back to the subject : with all those changes, you may be wondering how to message me from now on ..

<sub>🧷</sub> please don't hesitate to reach me out by sending an email to <a id="linkbjinho" href="mailto:letters@middlepot.com">letters@middlepot.com</a> or simply using the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://middlepot.com/contact" target="_blank">contact form</a> !
i do participate in small platforms & communities, and i like using all kinds of message boards on people's sites, but emails are the standard option of contacting someone on the internet.
i will always prefer a safe & organized space for talking, especially for giving support.
please, let me know if i can help, and i will do my best !!
i check my inbox frequently ( though i might still take some time to respond depending on how clogged it is ) , and i like to talk about all kinds of things through email, it's very comfortable .. like exchanging virtual letters <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

<sub>🧷</sub> i am also open for <font color="#bfa8a8">real life pen pals</font> from all over the world. from small postcards to big envelopes filled with stuff, i love exchanging all sorts of things, especially stationery and handmade small items <sub>💌</sub>
if interested, please let me know by email !

<sub>🧷</sub> i respond to <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> pupu mails too ( id : <font color="#bfa8a8">adm-puf</font> ) , but please don't talk about serious things in there, use the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life/contact" target="_blank">contact form</a> instead !!

<sub>🧷</sub> in the future, you can expect to be able to interact with me on <font color="#bfa8a8">my puf cafe pages</font> as well, of course.

<sub>🧷</sub> i can share my private discord tag & line id with friends. i do prefer a slower message exchanging though, as i like to write long messages !



by the way, i got many questions since i posted about my web code snippets, and some of you wanted to know if i have one for discord too !
the answer is : yes, i did make a script for discord as well <sub>🎀</sub>
at first it was only for inserting css, so i could make it pink .. but recently i updated it for also making the blocked people's messages disappear from the chat, which is nice !
it doesn't help with all the issues that come with their useless blocking feature, but it's better than nothing, right ?  

so here is my discord web code snippet, in case you fluffies want to try it out ( click the screenshot to get the .js file ) :</pre>

it is a very comfy theme, zero harsh color contrast. i made it to work with the dark theme, but it's alright with the light theme too !
i did my best to make it cute but also functional, so you can see both white and black stuff.
what do you think ? hopefully using it will make your experience with discord a bit nicer as well <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>



another thing i have been asked about is : tips for studying japanese !
thankfully, studying is one thing i have been trying to do consistently these past months, and i want to keep it that way.
i think the most common things that i do ( besides watching actual lesson videos ) is watching animes, dramas, random japanese videos .. and i also read mangas, doujinshis, visual novels, light novels, books and webtoons <sub>📚</sub>
there are also some stuff you can only listen to instead of reading, like cd dramas, but that's not recommended for beginners.
( by the way, dramas and webtoons have made me want to also learn korean so badly.. but i'm trying to go one step at a time )

oh, if you're a beginner, i suggest searching for media that are easy, made for children, instead of jumping into difficult things right away <sub>🐑</sub>
mm if you dislike cute child-like stuff, it might be a bit harder for you .. but, if you're reading my blog, you probably don't hate such things, am i right ?

okay : for actually learning something and not just consuming media ignoring all the japanese, it's important that you have two subtitles ( preferably with furigana as well ) and pay real deep attention to stuff people are saying. if you only have one subtitle ( being that english or japanese ) you must then pause to research any words you don't know !
it will be harder for you to grasp what people are saying with no subtitles, but it's interesting to watch things that way too, if the content is within your japanese level.
if you can, keeping a notebook aside for doing annotations of new words and sentences you've encountered is nice too, for reviewing later on. <sub>✏️</sub>

for readings i prefer to scan / download so i can do annotations on the pages freely, digitally.
that way, i can also color manga panels from time to time .. which is, certainly, a bit distracting - but a lot of fun nonetheless <sub>💖</sub>
these are some panels that i have colored and made annotations, from my favorite mangas :</pre>

( please also enjoy these cute scribbles i've drawn last week during listening practice, heh )

and remember : practice by both writing and talking. i personally like to write & record myself reading diary entries. i mostly write about stuff that i saw, what i think about it, and how i feel about it. <sub>☕️</sub>
i find it really therapeutic to do, so i try to write every day, if i'm not too tired !

making study fun and immersing yourself into the language is really motivating in the long run, even if it might take a bit longer to see progress !
when you start to find good content that is 100% in japanese, no translation available, you will naturally do your best to improve and try to understand things.



changing subjects completely now ..
i have been thinking about home decorations for some time now, since i have been working on graphics that are, well, home objects <sub>🧺</sub>
i love home related things in general, because it's in our house where we usually take time to relax and get comfy, and this is the feeling i like the most <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
while ott decorations with lots of cute items for only aesthetic purposes are really nice to look at, i found with time that it doesn't work out for everyone - and it doesn't work out for me.
i always knew that i'm more of a "minimalistic" person than the opposite, but because of my personal taste in aesthetics tend to be pretty "shabby chic" it feel a bit confusing to match those two, especially when it comes to house decor.
after researching a lot and living in my own house, i noticed that i prefer having only a few items in display, those that are useful or that i have a strong emotional connection with, so i can keep things clean & organized at all times <sub>🪑</sub>
i think a room can get 200% cuter by simply having a clean space, a soft color on the walls and ceiling, maybe a wallpaper and crown moldings .. and the floor is also really important to me, i love wooden floor with a passion !

the reality is that looking at so many things all over the place can be overwhelming for me, and i also don't have time and energy to clean everything throughfully everyday .. seeing things getting dusty over time makes one feel pretty upset, right ?
this thought have been reflected even on how i prefer to keep my virtual homes, like how the my fluffy life home design is simple and practical, but still cute <sub>🫖</sub>
getting rid of unnecessary items and giving priority to those that i use or truly care for have been really good for my mental health.
donating things to those who need more and seeing my house get more clean gave me a great refreshing feeling !
i also have been replacing some things that are old or not really my taste for new cuter versions, and it is so satisfying .. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i feel motivated to keep working hard when i see that my life is getting little "upgrades" here and there.

i noticed that for quite some time now, i have been filling my side interest to collect useless cute things and arrange ott decorations by doing collaging <sub>🎗</sub>
it's obviously not the same thing, but i actually find it a lot of fun and it's even better if it's something digital & interactive, such as my online game, because that way i can actually "live" inside those spaces without having to deal with all the stress in real life.
i also really love to do that with fashion, because i'm not willing to wear some kind of clothing for being uncomfortable in real life, but it's still lovely to be able to wear them on the digital world <sub>👚</sub><sub>👜</sub>

oh, another funny thing, is that i also try to fulfill some "obscure hobbies" or just hard / expensive activities that i can't keep doing in real life by making mini games about them !!
this is because of my experiences with games as a child : when i was little i used to play pretend that i was working at a job while playing flash games all the time. the same as playing pretend with toys, you know ?
but then i realized how fun digital games are even as an adult, so it's a bit nice to do that as well ( even more because i can make my own games as i like )
the internet world is magical in a way, like daydreaming with extra steps <sub>💕</sub>


on the topic of fashion, i have some cute new outfits to show you !!
they are ideal for the climate currently, since where i live is a little cold ( it's winter ) but still sunny sometimes, because well, tropical country <sub>🐌</sub>
i apologize once again for somehow consistently taking photos of my clothes when they're super wrinkled, i promise i always iron them before actually wearing <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font></pre>
the lighting was not good either because it was really rainy, but i tried to edit it anyway.

i love this outfit, so much !!! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i have sewn this short sleeved blouse ( my favorites ) and the dress is not new, but certainly got way cuter with the blouse combination. the fabric is cozy and super long so it is ideal for wearing right now, to avoid the occasional cold winds.

for coordinating i got these adorable new sneakers :</pre>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
this outfit is a bit more complicated, the top part is is a 3 piece overlay :
there is a short sleeved blouse underneath a strap sleeve blouse, and the collar is a separated piece above all.
the two blouses are the pieces i have sewn recently !
the bottom part is my long skirt that has a warm fabric, that i mentioned in one of my past posts, really comfortable for the current weather.
i love clothing that can be combined in different ways, for being able to plan many different outfits.
i can use all of these separatelly in outfits for all seasons, and i really like that <sub>🍦</sub>



talking on seasons, i know it's pretty late already, but i wanted to put here some screenshots from the spring season from <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> !!

the spring activities include : gardening roses and chrysanthemum, pollinating flowers, catching dandelions, and prepare flower arrangements. doesn't that sound delightful ?

and of course, during the april month we had an easter event <sub>🐇</sub>
there were many hidden easter eggs all around the worlds, and with them you could get "magic colors" for dyeing items on the easter stand, including all clothing, accessories, house decorations and even the fluffies' bodies !!
it was really really fun to do, and i dyed many items from my own wardrobe. now i have many extra clothing with different colors <sub>👗</sub></pre>

the dye system was far from perfect though, because we found that it is actually very hard to deal with colors depending on the brightness.. so dark colored items couldn't be dyed properly <sub>🩹</sub>
this feature is really important to to add the variety of unique items available on the game, so we studied a lot about it and found ways of improving it, so next time it will be a lot better and many issues will be fixed !!

another thing that i did for the spring season was a new temporary laptop shop, the "paper fairy store" for fairy themed clothing & accessories <sub>🌱</sub></pre>

hiii fluffies <sub>🐇</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it feels like it's been so long since i wrote here, right ?
i miss it, because it makes me rethink about everything.. this blog is a place where i feel safe to be myself and talk a whole lot. it's comforting. <sub>❤️</sub>
i intended to write this post weeks ago, but then i got terribly ill and only managed to do the bare minimum to survive during long 2 weeks <sub>💉</sub>
during and a while after that, i found myself once again lost into a depressive episode.
this time i wasn't burnout, but the opposite, almost ?
i noticed how fragile my health can be at times, and how it can be unrealiable. every beginning of the year is hard, with lots of bills and taxes to pay, and then i couldn't work.
( bubu couldn't work either because he was sick too, but thankfully he recovered faster than me .. )
still, there are many nice things to enjoy in life besides that, very cheap and low effort things - so after a bunch of coping i managed to feel somewhat motivated again LOL
my health is still at 80% but that's okay <sub>💊</sub>
certainly my routine changes that i did by january were great, taking time for self care and having the "tools" for doing so are a huge help !

i still managed to work on a few stuff, and fix others, such as the screen sizes adaptations i did for all my websites.
i'm used to small screen sizes, since i always use the laptop, but then bubu got a big screen for his pc and i noticed how tiny my sites look like on big screens .. !
i got concerned because even if everyone can use a little zoom, it's still inconvenient,, so i did my best to adapt the sizes doing the zoom myself !
i think it turned out okay, not perfect, but good enough.
making image based layouts work for every screen is hard <sub>💻</sub>

besides that, i also got two brand new domains recently :
<a id="linkbjinho" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank">shybunny.store</a> & <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://poofties.club" target="_blank">poofties.club</a> <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

i think it's best to have short domains like that for my main sites, because it's neat and practical to type !
i'm in love with these .. doesn't "poofties club" sound cute ?
it fits the website pretty well, since it's where you manage your account and everything <sub>🖇</sub>
( by the way, we're currently working on some new things for the poofties accounts, so keep an eye open )


whew, with the my fluffy life game release, the poofties account integrations, the renovated shy bunny store, the development of the new stationery system, and the puf bot and puf cafe too ( will talk about them below ) ..
there is a lot going on, and a lot of work to do, and there is a lot more coming, so i decided something a little drastic, but very necessary !
as you may already noticed, i have closed all my commissions completely : web design, graphic and photography editing, illustration, collaging, custom craft orders..
well, all commissions are now closed indefinitely. why ?

<sub>📍</sub> commissions take more time and energy to manage than regular orders, and already having a very full queue, dealing with commissions makes me terribly exhausted ..
<sub>📍</sub> i want to be able to focus on my projects, both personal ones and bigger ones, that will benefit you fluffies too, so you can still have custom content made by me, but also by yourself ;
<sub>📍</sub> you are already able to make cute graphics and illustrations of custom characters with my current projects if you have a poofties account, and once the shy bunny stationery page is ready to use it will make it possible to get lots of custom & exclusive items, including ones that i have been commissioning, but better than ever. you will be able to assemble things exactly the way you like, for cheaper and with better quality too !
<sub>📍</sub> you will be able to make very intricated websites using the puf cafe platform, and that will also be cheaper and more practical for you, since you can modify everything as many times as needed without the need of paying me for that ( and without the fear of breaking the layout, since html knowledge won't be necessary - but also applicable )

i hope you fluffies understand my decision !!
as you can see it is for the best, to all of us <sub>🤍</sub>
i will never ever abandon my career as a web & graphic designer, or anything - i'm just making sure that i can balance all my work properly, and make the best decision that will benefit everyone !!
keeping that many projects active require extreme organization and time management, and sadly, commissions are not very easy to manage, since you can't have control over the other person ..
so making platforms & games is the best i can do to offer my abilities and give people room for creativity, while having most things automated and neatly organized !
it is also way more fun to create things through cute games, isn't it ? <sub>🐈</sub>


well, i have another important change of plans to talk about today : remember i was working on a discord server for the poofties community ?
so .. it's not going to happen <sub>🥛</sub>
but there are some good reasons for that !
i think it's a bit obvious by now, but i am very cautious when it comes to work with platforms that i don't have complete freedom with ( that are not made by me, basically )
well, me and bubu actually use discord quite frequently for many years, so we have a lot of experience with this app - we have experimented with all of its utilities, and we know its flaws very well.
i do like using this app, when it comes to talking to my friends on very small servers, because that way i feel safer and more comfortable !

i was naively thinking that our poofties server would be that comfy small place for us to hang out, play some text games with the puf bot, and share things with each other <sub>🎀</sub>
the thing is, after seeing how my fluffy life easily grew up to a big number of players, being a PAID game, i got a bit scared ; ;
i have been mod and admin on both medium ( 100+ members ) and big ( 1k+ ) discord servers before, and it wasn't pleasant at all. the more the server was growing, the more stressed i felt, so i promised myself i wouldn't do that ever again.

this is a specific issue on discord though - our online game also have many users but is still incredibly easy to moderate. that's because, as it is paid and has a very niche public, trolls and hate accounts are super rare, and even when they appear everyone can deal with it very comfortably since our blocking feature and ban process are efficient.
now, comparing to discord : all kinds of people can and will find a public server, including trolls, gross predators, small children, edgy teens.. all at once !
and you can't efficiently ban weirdos, because they can just make another account and come back easily, start harrassing you on dms or other servers you are in, or even start to impersonate you to get you banned out of random servers. and, no one cares if you report them, at all.
also, i am completely disgusted on how impossible it is to block someone on discord, since you can still see their messages if you click on them ( imagine seeing "23 blocked messages" on a server, wouldn't you click it ?? i would, i'm too curious ) and they can still see yours and keep stalking you, and this is absurdly uncomfortable.

all of that isn't an issue if you're only on small servers with people you trust, and that's the only way i am willing to use discord now.
i also have made my chat app accounts private for only close friends, for the same reason : my safety. <sub>🗝</sub>
i think the poofties community is a bit bigger than a few hundreds of people by now, and if it keeps growing .. i won't be able to keep going with a public server, because i won't have the necessary tools to properly manage that. it's not safe enough !

if a server is public you can't really keep it small forever, even if you kick inactive members, because people on discord have that weird mentality of growing a server endlessly, accumulating thousands and thousands of people, instead of focusing on real and meaningful human interaction.
the more people are fighting, sending scam links, breaking simple rules, being randomly mean, harassing mods, the more they seem to be addicted to the ego boost of big numbers. <sub>🩹</sub>
people keep sharing server links everywhere like it's something good, they keep making "giveaways" to attract all kinds of random strangers .. i don't get that. why are people interested in buying others to enter a community ? if they are not interested in your community, just in getting some random prize for free, then what's the point ??
i understand the good intentions in trying to grow the community you love, but all the public servers i like end up becoming really uncomfortable the more they grow. i'm getting tired.. !

another thing, that is a small detail, but important for me nonetheless : i dislike that people need to pay so much money to release such basic features on servers ( the so-called boosts, that are very expensive ) and we still don't have much freedom with how we customize them.. we can't even change the colors !! 
come on, we used to have so much more customization on myspace for free, why is internet evolving backwards ?? 
yes i understand that discord needs to pay itself, it is completely fine for them to ask for financial support, they are always releasing new features ( though i wish their support was more effective, as i said above )
i am willing to support their platform as long as i use it and enjoy it - but, being completely honest .. i would feel really bad asking for expensive boosts just for us to have a couple of extra emojis, a small image on the corner, and a normal-looking link.
you can find servers asking for boosts all the time, and even asking for boosts after they already got the necessary for releasing all features. why throwing so much money away for nothing in return ??
i could replicate all of the features i like on my own platform in a way that i prefer, and much much more than that, without needing people to pay so much. so that's exactly what i'm going to do <sub>✂️</sub>
before i freak out and delete the server i worked so hard on, i rather never make it public while it's still on progress and just plan something else that is more efficient, safe, and reliable.

remember the "puf cafe" project ? it is going to be a virtual cafe, of course, and as it is a social game / website platform / many things ,, we were already planning on making a chatting feature, and the puf bot to have all of its functionalities available there..
so, as you can imagine, we can actually put some extra effort for making the group chat thing feel like a discord server ( even because discord is the group chat app that i like the most, so naturally i would include features of it in there )
line, being the chatting app that i love for talking with individual friends, will also be an inspiration for the chatting feature. <sub>📱</sub>
most of what i have planned so far for the poofties server will be better placed on the cafe, as it will be way more efficient, safer, cuter, and cheaper for everyone to actively participate !

mm i know you fluffies might be a bit confused about the "puf cafe" and the "puf bot" , since i only threw some hints about it here and there, but never actually explained what it is <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
very briefly : the puf cafe is supposed to be "the perfect social site" that i always dreamed of, for myself, my friends and the poofties community. <sub>☕️</sub>
the puf bot will be the "mascot" of the cafe : she will keep your files safe, shorten links, have an AI for being able to talk with users, play with them, moderate, and also help if they need support <sub>💗</sub>
we will keep adding more features for them according to our necessities, so we can make sure that the cafe is a nice place that can replace popular social media apps - and now, also, chatting apps.
i am sure that it won't be perfect for everyone, certainly, some people will still prefer other places,, but i am sure of what i personally need and can't find anywhere else, so i'm trying to make it happen.
consequently, it will be great for people who have similar needs than me, right ?

once we finish working on a test version of the puf cafe & bot, i will show you their websites so you can understand how things will work in more details !!
this is becoming our biggest project so far - even bigger than my fluffy life - so we are really really super excited <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font>
i know that it is daring to try and replace ( at least for myself ) such big platforms made by huge companies with our tiny itty bitty projects, but i won't give up on my dreams.
i am happy if we make it come true. i always consider my projects a complete success if they can bring a few smiles in the end of the day <sub>💕</sub>


changing subjects, do you fluffies remember when i posted a few months ago about the new apps i was trying out for organization, self care track, and productivity ?
by then, i mentioned procreate, which is a good ipad alternative for photoshop cs6, which is what i use on my laptop ( but not a substitute, for a bunch of reasons )
and, i also mentioned that i was starting to use notion for taking quick notes and making to do lists that i intend to delete later on anyway ( so it's way more convenient to do there than on photoshop or procreate ) ..

well, now that i have been studying japanese quite intensely ( kanjis are so stressful aa !!! ) i have been desperately trying to find a way to study on my ipad so i can write digitally and keep my notes neatly organized <sub>🖋</sub>
i was, until recently, using procreate for handwriting digitally anything on my ipad, but it turned out to be quite messy when it comes to studying or planning .. !
i tried to organize my notes on notion later on, or on my folders, but it wasn't working very well since i couldn't edit my notes later on .. and well, as life changes, plans change, and study notes need to be updated, right ?
keeping all of my procreate projects was not very convenient either, i tried ;;
( when i'm journaling things go very spontaneously and i don't intend to keep editing later on, so i just save it on my folders forever and it's completely fine )

what i needed was : an app where i could write well just like procreate, but also could organize my notes neatly, just like notion. could i possibly find the best of both worlds ?
yes, i found it : goodnotes 5 !!
it has been really great, since i can edit my templates on either procreate or photoshop, and then open them on goodnotes for writing, planning, and studying.
it is not as clean and quick as notion, and i can't edit images in there obviously, but it is still great for studying or planning : i keep my notes safe, organized, i can work on them carefully enough, and i also can edit them as many times as needed. highly recommended <sub>💟</sub>

the only sad thing is that goodnotes isn't available for pc or android, so i have to backup my notes manually for being able to check it on other devices ( and that way i can't edit them ) ..
so, for now, i'm still relying on notion for things that i need to keep checking multiple times during the day.


okay, so let's go for the content i did for <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my fluffy life</a> recently !!
it's been a while, but i still haven't posted about the valentine's day event :</pre>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it was a simple event, but very cute and with a bunch of new items !
there was this little thematic stand where you could go and write valentine's cards to your friends using exclusive stationery, and give them chocolates. <sub>💘</sub>
depending on the chocolate you choose, your friend would receive an amount of "love" , that is a currency that you can use to buy exclusive clothing on the stand !
so, this event was completely focused on exchanging cards and lots of love ( literally ) with everyone. isn't that adorable ? <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i also really love the motifs & colors .. i tried to include lots of hearts and strawberries <sub>🍓</sub>

oh, after releasing this event, i got to color another beautiful coloring page from my friend <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://dollrosenheart.wixsite.com/sketchblog" target="_blank">babydollsheart</a> !!
i used similar colors to the ones from the event :</pre>

it's so so cute <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
it really puts me into the mood of writing some cheesy love poems .. and eating a slice of cake too <sub>🍰</sub>

now we're halfway through working on the easter event and spring season, besides some other things.
we're a little late because of the inconveniences of life mentioned, but i still hope to release the new event in time for the holiday !


aaa i also wanted to show you fluffies a lovely gift i got from my friend <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://uwuboa.neocities.org" target="_blank">uwuboa</a> !!</pre>

it's me <sub>💖</sub>
she completely surprised me, and i was during week 2 of being sick, so i really needed it.. i'm so grateful, so happy, it looks super soft <sub>🌷</sub>
i treasure those little things .. it's the kind of stuff that never fails to make me smile even years after !

before finishing this post i wanted to show you some outfits that i made, as promised last post, but eep i couldn't finish much so there are no photos yet <sub>📷</sub>
the only photo i took was from my new shoes & socks :</pre>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i'm in love with these, matches almost all my clothes <sub>🥿</sub>
i hope to finish my other outfits soon, because i want to wear them so badly .. !
again i have been trapped inside home because of sickness, so i can't wait to go outside next week and be carefree. <sub>🏠</sub>

it's okay to sometimes just rest and do nothing all day, especially when you're not feeling well.
i feel that i expect too much from me in a short time, but it's hard not to when time goes by so fast,, i have plans for the next 6 months ahead !
but you know what ? it's okay if things get delayed. it's not like i must finish things as fast as possible, to reach some kind of fulfillment.
if anything, i just want to reach happiness, and we all can reach that at any time if we let go of the worries for a moment ..
let's try our best to keep going, okay ?</pre><br>

hiii fluffies <sub>🎀</sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
how is 2022 going for you, so far ?
it's been great for me, since i finally got some rest after so much work for the holidays events on <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://myfluffy.life" target="_blank">my game</a>, and sales on <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://shybunny.store" target="_blank">my store</a> .. !
i tried to keep doing my important tasks, but also got plenty of days off for myself, because it was really needed.
i don't really make new year's resolutions, but i like to take the time for valuing my life as it is, plan solutions for my current bothers, and reorganize my schedule.

i was feeling very depressed lately, besides being so happy about other things.. so i am currently taking efforts to change that !
sometimes we forget about taking care of ourselves, tidying the space we live, taking time for our loved ones, or to work on hobbies & small projects that we are passionate about .. without thinking too much, or expecting things in return <sub>🌷</sub>
working and studying is important, but the most important is that we are happy and satisfied with our lives, and we can't have that by rejecting half of our needs !!

thinking on that, i realized that i needed to make active changes on some things, and i was not actually lacking on motivation but on body energy and i also needed some help with things.
i bought some products to help me with skin care, housework, crafting materials ( so i can finish some projects that were on hold ), and items that could help me relax or fidget ( so i can avoid unhealthy habits that come with boredom, such as picking my skin, or overthinking ) .
i bought two absolutely beautiful <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://www.instagram.com/miki.takei" target="_blank">takei miki</a> coloring books, and i am so excited to scan the pages and start coloring the lovely illustrations !! <sub>✏️</sub>
i also went outside more often ( beyond my backyard ) , and i even started doing makeup again after months, although it's always very simple and natural, it does make me feel pretty. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

i thought that the pandemic would have a worse effect on my relationship with the "outside world" and worsen my social anxiety, but i don't think that's the case.
surprisingly, i realized how much i really really missed going on small dates with bubu, dressing up, seeing new things, and being carefree <sub>🍰</sub>
my craving for happy moments is bigger than anything else !

another concern is that since i work so hard for my money, sometimes i feel really guilty because i know i could spend money on projects that are really important for me .. but we deserve to spend money on random things, for simply feeling happy. we work hard and deserve that, as much as anyone else, right ?
as long as we don't spend all our money on silly things and end up debted, it is completely fine. <sub>👜</sub>
money can't buy happiness, and the endless seek for it can actually bring lots of sadness.. it never stops, you always want more and more. i think we should care more about living in the present. money is simply a tool, and should be used to benefit our lives instead of controlling how we live it !

okay, so to finally begin sharing the content that i have worked on lately, let's check the my fluffy life christmas event & winter season :</pre>
<br><br>

i made the christmas event to bring a nostalgic feeling of comfort and warmth, and focused it on sharing love, gifts and wishes with others <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
you could get ornaments ( that also can be used as stickers ) on the gacha machine, decorate the big christmas tree together with everyone, write wish letters, and put gifts in there for others to pick !! <sub>🎁</sub>

i am proud with the results, as i don't get to enjoy christmas as much as when i was a child ( and i know many people feel the same ) , my fluffy life helped me ( and hopefully other fluffies ) to get into the "spirit" , take some time to listen to winter-y music, think about happy fuzzy feelings, and feel hopeful & grateful about life. this is all i aimed for <sub>🎄</sub>
the two mini games that became available with this update are about comforting activities that you can do at home, such as baking cookies and sewing plushies ( that you can get home with you !! )</pre>

for the winter i decorated the village with lots of frills, lace & ribbons, fairy lights, and there are also some very cute snow teddies. the winter season is, currently, my personal favorite, as i absolutely adore snow landscapes <sub>💟</sub>
the third winter mini game is a classic snow sledding game, and by playing it you get lots of happiness !!

i also made some new winter clothing and furnitures for the shops, including a fireplace with crackling sounds and everything .. it is so comforting, i love it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
there are also some free items such as an apron that you get by playing the baking mini game, and of course, the sweaters that were made during autumn !

later on, i added a very cute laptop shop that will be available until spring, that sells babyish clothing and accessories <sub>👶</sub>
i was waiting for this update for the longest time, it's adorable ..
on this shop, you buy the items using happiness instead of teddycoins. we are experimenting different currencies for balancing the game economy a bit, since there are some very wealthy players, and we want to keep the game fun for everyone !</pre>

you fluffies seem to really like these new updates, and i'm really thankful with your patience and support <sub>💝</sub>
i feel really blessed seeing the number of accounts growing so fast, but i am most happy with seeing players returning to the game with each update and having fun..
my fluffy life is our happy place, and i just want to keep it safe and comforting, even if sometimes i need to take a step back from reaching more people ( who could be harmful to the community ) .
as i said before, money should never have priority over our peace of mind !


so, since the big holiday events have already passed, we will have time to work on important things for the game that we couldn't before.
currently i am working on the valentine's day updates, while bubu is working hard on optimizing the way that the game loads images - this requires many changes on the software architecture, but it is suuuuper important because it will make the game ligther, which is very necessary because with each update the game is getting harder to open on older devices .. and we intend to keep uploading more and more content forever, so that can't keep happening, right ?
hopefully that update will make everyone able to play with no issues of lack of memory, and i hope you fluffies will enjoy the new valentine's day items as well <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

after this update, we will work on features that have been on hold for such a long time ( such as visiting homes, sharing diary pages with friends to make a "guestbook" , the database page, clothing and furniture previews, dyes for bodies.. )
and, of course, we will work on the browser version of the game, which is the most important of all. <sub>💻</sub>
it will come with lots of advantages, since it will be published by ourselves on its own website, so we have freedom to update it instantly for everyone at once, it works integratedly on all devices .. and many many other great things, that i will let you know when it's the right time !!


now, returning to the "working on changes to solve issues" topic : i have realized that some of my digital projects were being neglected by me because of how uncomfortable i feel when using social media, to share that content and reach people. <sub>🐌</sub>
the simpler solution would be, of course, deleting my accounts and posting on a place where i feel happier - but that place still doesn't exist, and while i don't make one, i have to solve that issue as much as i can so i can keep going !

you might know that i have been using code snippets for the longest time to cutify some websites ( such as changing colors, background patterns, fonts.. ) but i have only recently thought of using them for more than only aesthetics.
i realized that seeing the metric numbers ( such as following count, likes, and sometimes even comments ) were being very stressful and unmotivating for me, for many reasons that i have been talking endlessly about through all these years. <sub>🖋</sub>
so, as experimentation, i removed all the metrics. all of them.
not only numbers, but also public comments, because i'm tired of seeing unwanted drama everywhere, people fighting on comments, and other things that have nothing to do with the content, that just annoys me to no end ..
if i feel safe enough to see comments on a specific account, from a friend for example, i can simply deactivate the script for that moment !
i can still like posts normally, comment on them, and check my own notifications so i can respond to people and see who responded me, so it haven't negatively affected my usability on these platforms.

i made scripts for all the social media sites that i am currently using ( click the screenshots to get the .js files ) :</pre>

as you can see, each one of them has a slightly different appearance ( i customized them very spontaneously ) , but all of them have the metric numbers and public comments hidden, and some other things as well ( such as trending posts ) <sub>🎗</sub>
i will keep my web code snippets updated whenever needed, and you can always check the latest version on my <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://middlepot.com/portfolio#webcodesnippets" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">portfolio</font></a> page !

keep in mind that these codes were made by me, thinking on my own needs, and i am sharing it with you fluffies exactly as i use them <sub>🗝</sub>
you are free to use them as you personally like, and modify according to your preferences. if you have some practice with css it should be enough for changing colors, images, or removing some stuff i did. feel free to experiment around !!

i wish i could be more of an active help to others, and if i have to insert javascript into websites for achieving a more comfortable user experience, i am sharing them with you, in hopes to help in some way.

the reality is that we have no control over our personal information on these platforms ( yes i do consider numbers something very personal, as it is clearly used for judging our "success" and "relevance" ) .
on instagram, a few interaction numbers are hidden by standard ( at least for me ) but not the following count, while on youtube you can hide a few numbers, but not all of them either.
tumblr gives options to hide both followers & notes - but only on your own blog, not on the tumblr site or app.
twitter won't let you hide anything.
it really really bothers me, deeply, so i look forward to more ways to hide all the unnecessarily stressing numbers from everyone, not only those who use my scripts, but i don't keep my hopes up <sub>🌧</sub>

i don't think those platforms care, at all, about people's mental health. hiding numbers would lead people to stop getting addicted to using social media for getting validation, and that means less money to them, right ?

that's why i will work in solutions for this issue, by making my own safe spaces, that i can share with you fluffies <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
for now, i think those scripts are being a big help for me, and i hope they can help you as well .. at least a little bit

using those scripts + cutifying the pages certainly work very well, not only for coping, but for healing as well.
i might never be able to feel 100% comfortable using social platforms, but i feel at least .. 40% more comfortable, and that is a lot, i must say !

but of course : inserting codes to hide some things, besides being a very useful tool, it's only a temporary solution for the real problem .. better saying, i am coping, not actually improving platforms for everyone. <sub>💻</sub>
sadly, deep down, i know that people are still able to see all the numbers, and will judge others based on them just as much as the next person.
that, itself, is a bit unmotivating.. i also can't run away from all the bothering posts that get suggested for me, weird dms from strangers, or avoid platforms to stop my posts from reaching more people because it's not "trending".
those are extra issues that come with posting on social media actively, so i am looking forward to avoid that as a whole, by only opening these sites sporadically for checking specific content that i like, then going away.

nonetheless, keeping myself away from looking to numbers all the time is absolutely refreshing, and is doing wonders to my mental health <sub>💐</sub>
sometimes i would feel so sad about social media that i would just avoid it for the longest time, but at least for now i need to actively post on these platforms to reach people & grow my community ( hopefully not in the future, as i work on new solutions )

explaining in more detail : as an inactive user, just looking around and visiting people's accounts, i would say that the experience is heavily improved by the removal of mentioned problematic aspects of platform websites.
i feel okay, specially on tumblr & youtube, because their recommendations are highly advertised by content you explicitly interacted with + you can easily avoid the advertised posts with paid subscriptions ; which makes the experience of using them more enjoyable than other platforms !
but, as an active user / content creator, the experience is just half improved by the scripts, and no platforms fill my needs properly.. <sub>🩹</sub>
all posts has to be painfully adapted to each platform particularities ( which really takes away my possibilities as a creator ) , i miss a lot of necessary features, and am constantly unhappy with the way platforms treats me, with how random strangers are able to treat me .. i feel unsafe.

yes, i can't possibly avoid all the issues unless i stop using these platforms as a whole, but i can avoid myself from getting upset about many things on a daily basis - i have to make an effort to think about the issues that numbers cause, instead of being reminded of them all the time.
this is good enough for now, i'm proud of my efforts for the time being !!

i try my best to keep going and working on my projects, for being able to be helpful for the <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://poofties.club" target="_blank">poofties</a> community. i know i don't post a lot, and i apologize for that .. it is very hard for me, but i know you fluffies are looking forward to the content i post on my accounts. i want to inspire & comfort you all, so i try to keep going, as i can. <sub>🦋</sub>
once i can release my puf café project, finish working on the puf bot, i hope to finally free myself and be able to post content in a safe place where i can do things as i like <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
( i will share more detailed information about those projects in future posts ! )

well, it's always easier said than done : don't compare your growth to other peoples', don't pay attention to numbers, don't keep reading rude words, don't get involved in drama .. of course you shouldn't do any of that, but it's too hard to avoid when it's all over the place !!
i noticed just how much i used to compare myself to other people and getting randomly upset with random drama that have nothing to do with me, when i stopped being able to do that. if i can't see it, i don't know it exist. <sub>✂️</sub>
it is completely different avoiding getting informed about important things that are happening, and just avoiding unnecessary stress and ridiculous drama. please allow yourself to be free from that !

using "not only cuter but also improved" platforms this past month has made my experience with them a lot less heavy. now i open my feed and i don't feel disgusted, yay !
do i feel happy though ? sometimes, yes, i like checking cute & comforting content, which inspires me a lot and keeps me motivated <sub>💘</sub>
but as i mentioned above, posting features are very limited and i feel unsafe. there are lots of ugly stuff going on .. i just often don't know exactly what it is, or how ugly it is, giving my efforts into avoiding it.

i don't want to be part of this, and help those ugly platforms grow stronger. that's why i will stick to the plan, and never give up !!
it is a big and very complicated project, but i believe in my dreams.
i somehow made an online game, and that's because bubu, my loved ones, you fluffies, are giving me all the support in the world !! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
so i must work hard for us all, to have our very deserved comfort spaces, because it is never too much to ask for <sub>🫖</sub>


okay, but.. how to apply these web code snippets ? ( i will put this into my /faq page )
there are multiple ways of inserting javascript into a website, but i will tell you how i personally prefer to do it :

<sub>📍</sub> on my <b>pc</b>, i use the opera browser, and there we can use chrome extensions, so i use the "<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inject-code/jpbbdgndcngomphbmplabjginoihkdph" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">inject code</font></a>" one. i tested multiple things, including inserting the code directly on the "inspect element" settings, but that extension is the most reliable way to insert the codes automatically to websites so far ( and it's very easy to use too ) .

<sub>📍</sub> on my <b>android</b> phone, i use the kiwi browser, and there we can use chrome extensions, so i also use the "<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inject-code/jpbbdgndcngomphbmplabjginoihkdph" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">inject code</font></a>" one, and it works perfectly just as on pc. keep in mind that the youtube code only works on the "desktop view" of the site, but the other codes work okay on the mobile versions too. my tip is : use your phone horizontally when on youtube, and you will simply get used to it.

<sub>📍</sub> on my <b>ipad</b>, i use the safari browser, and i use the "<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safari-snippets/id1126048257" target="_blank"><font color="#ccb1b1" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #ccb1b1; padding-bottom: 0px; font-size:10px;">snippets</font></a>" app for inserting the codes manually on each website, as i enter them. it works pretty similarly to the "shortcuts" app ( it was freezing my ipad because the codes are too big, so i just downloaded the "snippets" as an alternative ) . you have to click on the "share" symbol on safari and then on the "inject snippet" button so you can insert the code on each website, after opening them. sadly, i found no automatic way to do that on ios .. so my tip is : have a clean profile saved on bookmarks so you won't risk seeing "unwanted" content once entering websites, before applying your code !


now, to finish this post, i'll share with you some outfit projects that i have finished recently.
i didn't sew or go thrifting much this last year, so i barely had any new clothing to show you .. so i took the time to do so, from december !
coordinating new outfits is something i really love to do, especially when it includes some modified thrifted pieces. it somehow feels really special to wear vintage clothing <sub>🤍</sub>
you might have already seen some new nightgowns that i have on photos that i took, on the /fashion page ( which i reposted on my tumblr blog as well ) , so i'm only going to show you on this post outfits that i haven't took pictures using yet.
sorry about the wrinkly fabric <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font></pre>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
a really comfortable outfit for summer, with a "sailor" blouse and a long skirt <sub>👒</sub>
i am in love with the skirt in particular, as it is super soft and i can coordinate it with many other white blouses that i have !!
long white skirts are really important pieces of my wardrobe, so i also have another one that has a thicker cotton fabric and is ideal for winter.</pre>
<br><br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
this one became quickly one of my favorite outfits, because of the warm cute colors, the lace details, and the comfort of wearing it !!
the fabrics are all very soft .. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
the blouse has a very cute lace collar, and the long sleeves aren't very warm so i can wear it on mild weather, or cold weather, with a sweater above. <sub>🥿</sub>
i like wearing a cotton bloomer underneath, so i also included it on the photo, since it's a new one !
it has cute lace, it's very poofy, and has small ribbons on the sides.</pre>
<br><br>

<center><img width="370px" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/IMsVM4W.jpg">

<br>

</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
this is a dress that looks simple, but has very complicated lace details.
because of the cotton fabric it could be used in many ways : with or without a blouse underneath, with or without a petticoat, and so on .. it's a very versatile dress !
i included my new layered petticoat on the photo, since i have weared it that way last time and it looked very cute <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

i have been sewing some new petticoat & underwear recently. they are essential pieces of a wardrobe, right ?

those are the petticoats that i have :
<sub>🧷</sub> simple a-line underskirt <font color="#c4b6b1">( ideal for wearing underneath casual skirts )</font>
<sub>🧷</sub> cotton bralette <font color="#c4b6b1">( for combining with the underskirt mentioned above, it replaces a regular bra )</font>
<sub>🧷</sub> simple a-line underdress <font color="#c4b6b1">( basically a onepiece combination of the two above, and i use it often with casual dresses )</font>
<sub>🧷</sub> bloomer <font color="#c4b6b1">( can be used as an alternative to the skirt petticoat, or underneath one. if enough fabric, it adds some poof to the skirt )</font>
<sub>🧷</sub> crinoline petticoat <font color="#c4b6b1">( ideal for summer, since you won't feel any fabrics against your skin, but you must wear a bloomer underneath )</font>
<sub>🧷</sub> layered petticoat <font color="#c4b6b1">( gives a good poof to skirts or dresses, it's very cozy for winter time, and allows you to sit down and "fit" into spaces more easily )</font>

high quality socks and panties are very important as well <sub>🧦</sub>
those are all pieces that are quite easy to find, or to sew. add lace to each piece for extra cuteness ( just don't forget to match everything carefully ) .
i see that many people who are getting started with their wardrobes have a hard time understanding how important petticoats are for coordinating ( something that should be thought on layers ) , so i hope that my quick explanations helped !

there are some other clothing that i'm working on but haven't finished, so i will show you on next posts !!
i'm also making and buying some new accessories such as scrunchies, hair pins, and headbands.
i am planning to make new item options for the shy bunny store soon, but only after i finish preparing the stationery items <sub>🖇</sub>

that's it for today .. !
i hope that this new year will be full of happy memories for us all <sub>⭐</sub>
let's try our best to prioritize our health, solve issues that are bothering us, to live wholeheartedly, and mindfully.
