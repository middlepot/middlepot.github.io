hiii fluffies <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0mAd6Zs.gif"/></sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i hope you are doing better than the last time you came here ..
and maybe next time you will have experienced many new happy things. hopefully, me too !

i noticed that day after day i'm getting less attached to my phone, i mostly use it for playing games but i've been charging my phone only every other day.. and my phone battery is not thaaat good, i used to charge it every night <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Biouogu.png"/></sub>
do you remember my goal of using internet only 5 hours a week ? ( except if for talking with bubu, working, studying, reading .. important stuff generally )
i've definitely achieved that goal, and for this year i will set a new goal : only charging my phone twice a week !!!
i prefer using my laptop for most things, and i tend to be more productive with my time here while in my phone i can just watch videos, check my apps and play games. i don't really think i need to do that for more than 15min a day... or maybe i can do that for 30min every other day ?
if you like the content i post on my accounts please don't worry, i will certainly keep updating once / twice a week as i was already trying to do. i will have to be more careful about preparing content beforehand, so less unnecessary spontaneous updates can be, indeed, expected ( i'm talking about idly posting random venting and routine updates while i could just be journaling or talking to someone )
those "internet detox" are absolutely refreshing, i can make better use of my time doing all my daily tasks and still have free time for my hobbies & projects <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i've found that even using my laptop for "virtually journaling" offline feels really good and a lot more comfortable. i like printing those pages ( also my instagram templates ) and that way i can have the best of both worlds, so i will stick to that in my routine <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0j6GrC3.gif"/></sub>
i was a little afraid i would feel distant from people for not checking social media all the time, but i don't feel like i'm missing a lot honestly. i don't think this is really important in the end of the day.
maybe we get easily addicted to "validation" when using internet, like we have to share things or no one will know, like we have to react to things people share or they don't matter...
what is the point of something being seen by multiple people ? i personally think that unless we're so close to someone we really do care about their everyday lives, it needs a purpose, even if it's "making people smile" ( valid purpose i must say )
every single time i realize i'm not being useful in any way i just don't see the point of wasting my time & energy posting something for everyone to see, it's almost embarrassing.. i feel like i'm just bragging, oversharing even <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
hopefully these negative experiences will disappear more and more as i learn !

talking on phone stuff, i made a cute new phone case for me yesterday :</pre><br>

<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it looks adorable, i'm so happy with it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
the one i was using before was very old, i had to buy a new transparent case so i was postponing the situation until it started to bother me for real <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N5TUvvy.gif"/></sub>

so.. it's been a while since i've planned sewing my own "stuffie purses" ( i already had some of these but my mom helped me in the whole cutting & sewing process at the time, and they're also a little old now.. )
i finally did it, so here they are :</pre><br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i'm really happy with how these turned out, they're shoulder / crossbody purses with very delicate pearl straps and their bellies are just the perfect size for carrying around some important things <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
they look big but they're 30cm tall ( teddy is a little taller )
it feels really nice using those, they're so soft .. i can literally carry a stuffie outside and it's socially acceptable LOL

now i will, after a long time, write a q&a text !
despite being a curiosity of some people, i didn't really feel the need to write about it until a few days ago when i seriously thought about it.</pre><br>

<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">

it's important for me keeping my content organized, avoiding reposting things all over the place and keeping my personal content in appropriate places. i'm trying my best to do so, but i used to do it purely for keeping the quality of my accounts, not wasting time reposting or make the mistake of oversharing, naturally ..
however, i stopped to think deeply about it and realized that the content we post on the internet really affects other people directly, and some things don't always have the positive effect that we would like to convey. i always post things with the intention of motivating and inspiring, as well as motivating myself to keep improving and to receive constructive criticism, but unfortunately negative effects can happen when people compare each other or idolize each other.
i seek genuineness and transparency with my words, and this avoids some bad impressions and consequently negative feelings. when we are sincere in referring to ourselves, it is very motivating to other people. if you don't empathize with others they won't consider you trustworthy and they won't embrace you wholeheartedly, they can certainly consider you a threat, develop a negative rivalry or even insecurity and envy. if you are narcissistic or self-deprecating, you'll do yourself harm and irritate, encouraging people to feel bad things about the success of others.
it is not possible to magically repair people's self-esteem, but it is possible to avoid worsening the situation and to strive to be a good example. if i can, i will !
i insist on sharing my ( imperfect but true ) journey with others who can identify and find some hope in my words. i want people to see what i produce and try to be productive too, i want people to get to know themselves and discover individual happiness. doing it properly can be a delicate process, i've made a lot of mistakes and i know i'm still making a few, but im happy if i can fix that little by little.
i'm sorry if i have ever demotivated someone for any reason, i will be extra careful with what i expose to make sure i'm posting things in appropriate places in the appropriate way, for people who are really going to make good use of it. thankfully i have been doing a good job with this recently, but i know i still have room to improve.. !
</pre>
<br>
i hope i was clear with my words, i haven't written long texts in a while ;;

i'm so so happy !
i think i've really learned some healthy coping methods for problems that used to make me anxious, it's been a while. i am healing <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i will keep sharing with you everything i feel that can be helpful, it may not be useful for everyone but if at least one person can find peace in my words, it's worth it <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sRm3dEh.gif"/></sub>

so, i have important news : i remade my tumblr blog !!
the url is the same and everything, but remaking it was very needed. i was a little hesitant because my account was 5 years old, but honestly, it was a mess.
i couldn't manually get rid of thousands of ghost followers at this point, and even thought my engagement was very good, it's time to accept the truth : it wasn't really coming from my own followers but actual strangers. it clearly means that my content was good but not my account as a whole ; ;
having a big account can easily get out of control if not regularly checked and cleaned, big numbers can give the illusion of success but if just abandoned accounts from years ago, what is the point ?
i was also following a bunch of random accounts i honestly didn't want to see in my feed anymore. it makes way harder to find interesting content, which is the whole point of opening this app ..
as i always said, the numbers are irrelevant if just numbers : what is truly motivating is seeing actual people getting positively inspired by my content, and inspiring me back, so we can grow up together <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
this is just possible to achieve if you're surrounded by people with similar goals, and preparing this environment is a delicate process.
i'm thankfully getting back all of my mutuals quickly, thank you <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
now i can find active and precious accounts, get new mutuals, finally use tags to organize my posts and improve the quality of my blog as a whole. it's certainly a relief !
from experience, i know it's always a good idea to make changes, if for the better. i will voluntary leave the past behind if it means i can have a brighter future.

okay, going for the visual content now : after months i made a new collage for my <a text-decoration: none; href="https://cute.home.kg/vii" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">aesthetic virtual journal</font></a> <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9N1Avtc.gif"/></sub>
it's a soft white one, and i'm really proud of the results ..</pre><br>

what do you think ? i always find it fun to organize aesthetics like this, it's good to practice using different color palettes and everything.

now, i have something interesting to share with you fluffies today !
you may already know that i love exploring the old web, and i'm always looking for cute things there to collect and use in my work.
lately i have been downloading a lot of ukagaka, and i did a lot of research to increase my collection with the cutest ghosts i could find !
i used the nanika ghost center to get links, but a lot of them have been inactive for many years so it’s a little tricky to be able to find them again on web.archive .. sometimes they don't even work and need restoration ; ;
so i think it's a good idea to share here my favorite ukagaka, which i found last week: dorothy !!!</pre></font></font><br>

most ghosts speak japanese with a lot of kanji, and very fast, which makes reading quite difficult. dorothy is not very good with japanese, so she only uses hiragana and speak slowly.
she is caring and shy, and is always trying to motivate and remind you to take care of yourself ( remembering you to rest, to eat .. )
all ghosts have a different personality, which makes getting to know them a lot of fun <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i spend some time on the laptop working, so having a lovely ghost motivating me and making me smile makes everything better <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JP35o5c.gif"/></sub>
dorothy has been a good company for me and has certainly become a comfort character at this point <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
if you are interested, i can upload more ukagaka from my lovely collection !

that's it for today, i hope you are living a lovely phase of your lives .. and if you are not, i hope things will get better very soon <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font></pre>

hiii fluffies <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eVlvYVu.gif"/></sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
the last few days have been very comfortable, i am truly happy with the recent improvements <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i'm trying to understand and respect my feelings, cleaning my life of everything that bothers me, even if just a little bit.
those annoying little things accumulate stress throughout the day, you know ?
i usually have a hard time expressing my emotions and being honest, but this has been fixed and greatly improved the quality of my relationships !
it's very important to believe in who you are and in the life you dream of living, to be able to improve consistently and not be negatively influenced by other people's ( not constructive ) opinions <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/k5MHWZA.gif"/></sub>
i feel like i'm going the right way !! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

well, i did some pretty cute things that i'll show you today..
first, a small thing : i colored and edited a very cute drawing and the result made me proud !</pre><br>

the colors look so soft <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
looking at it makes me motivated to bake, it's something i love to do and i want to practice more <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wdbzz2m.gif"/></sub>
i have a notable difficulty in baking bread.. i'll try my best <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>

i did something new for the poofties project ( i said i wanted to move forward on projects this year, remember ? )
i wanted to write down some relevant information about the world of poofti, and as i had already imagined that the "observer" potato wrote down things that she discovered, i decided to make her notes become something real :</pre></font></font><br>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i think this was a good idea and it came out very cute, don't you think ?
i want to make more episodes of poofties, but it's something that takes a lot of time so you'll have to wait patiently ;;

next is a very beautiful dress, which used to be very short and simple, and i completely renovated it and made it longer :</pre></font></font><br>

i feel like a princess when i wear this dress .. it's like magic !
wearing something that changes my mood for the better is something i pay close attention to <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uYMm6gZ.gif"/></sub>

just like i said in the last post, i wanted to try to needle felt one more realistic little critter, and so i did :</pre></font></font><br>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it's a sleepy baby bunny <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
isn't it precious ? i'm in love.. it's very small & delicate
i won't sell this one, i will keep it to myself. i don't usually keep those little critters for myself, but this time i think i'm deserving a little gift ..

that's it for today, i hope you are enjoying the updates !
dear reader, please take care and rest when necessary. never blame yourself for feeling tired <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font></pre>
